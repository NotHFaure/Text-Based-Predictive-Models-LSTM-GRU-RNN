the wanderer we had a very serious conversation in buckingham street that night about the domestic occurrences i have detailed in the last aunt was deeply interested in them and walked up and down the room with her arms folded for more than two hours afterwards whenever she was particularly discomposed she always performed one of these pedestrian feats and the amount of her discomposure might always be estimated by the duration of her walk on this occasion she was so much disturbed in mind as to find it necessary to open the bedroom door and make a course for herself comprising the full extent of the bedrooms from wall to wall and while mr dick and i sat quietly by the fire she kept passing in and out along this measured track at an unchanging pace with the regularity of a clockpendulum when my aunt and i were left to ourselves by mr dick’s going out to bed i sat down to write my letter to the two old ladies by that time she was tired of walking and sat by the fire with her dress tucked up as usual but instead of sitting in her usual manner holding her glass upon her knee she suffered it to stand neglected on the chimneypiece and resting her left elbow on her right arm and her chin on her left hand looked thoughtfully at me as often as i raised my eyes from what i was about i met hers ‘i am in the lovingest of tempers my dear’ she would assure me with a nod ‘but i am fidgeted and sorry’ i had been too busy to observe until after she was gone to bed that she had left her nightmixture as she always called it untasted on the chimneypiece she came to her door with even more than her usual affection of manner when i knocked to acquaint her with this discovery but only said ‘i have not the heart to take it trot tonight’ and shook her head and went in again she read my letter to the two old ladies in the morning and approved of it i posted it and had nothing to do then but wait as patiently as i could for the reply i was still in this state of expectation and had been for nearly a week when i left the doctor’s one snowy night to walk home it had been a bitter day and a cutting northeast wind had blown for some time the wind had gone down with the light and so the snow had come on it was a heavy settled fall i recollect in great flakes and it lay thick the noise of wheels and tread of people were as hushed as if the streets had been strewn that depth with feathers my shortest way homeand i naturally took the shortest way on such a nightwas through st martin’s lane now the church which gives its name to the lane stood in a less free situation at that time there being no open space before it and the lane winding down to the strand as i passed the steps of the portico i encountered at the corner a woman’s face it looked in mine passed across the narrow lane and disappeared i knew it i had seen it somewhere but i could not remember where i had some association with it that struck upon my heart directly but i was thinking of anything else when it came upon me and was confused on the steps of the church there was the stooping figure of a man who had put down some burden on the smooth snow to adjust it my seeing the face and my seeing him were simultaneous i do not think i had stopped in my surprise but in any case as i went on he rose turned and came down towards me i stood face to face with mr peggotty then i remembered the woman it was martha to whom emily had given the money that night in the kitchen martha endellside by side with whom he would not have seen his dear niece ham had told me for all the treasures wrecked in the sea we shook hands heartily at first neither of us could speak a word ‘mas’r davy’ he said gripping me tight ‘it do my art good to see you sir well met well met’ ‘well met my dear old friend’ said i ‘i had my thowts of coming to make inquiration for you sir tonight’ he said ‘but knowing as your aunt was living along wi’ youfur i have been down yonderyarmouth wayi was afeerd it was too late i should have come early in the morning sir afore going away’ ‘again’ said i ‘yes sir’ he replied patiently shaking his head ‘i am away tomorrow’ ‘where were you going now’ i asked ‘well’ he replied shaking the snow out of his long hair ‘i was agoing to turn in somewheers’ in those days there was a sideentrance to the stableyard of the golden cross the inn so memorable to me in connexion with his misfortune nearly opposite to where we stood i pointed out the gateway put my arm through his and we went across two or three publicrooms opened out of the stableyard and looking into one of them and finding it empty and a good fire burning i took him in there when i saw him in the light i observed not only that his hair was long and ragged but that his face was burnt dark by the sun he was greyer the lines in his face and forehead were deeper and he had every appearance of having toiled and wandered through all varieties of weather but he looked very strong and like a man upheld by steadfastness of purpose whom nothing could tire out he shook the snow from his hat and clothes and brushed it away from his face while i was inwardly making these remarks as he sat down opposite to me at a table with his back to the door by which we had entered he put out his rough hand again and grasped mine warmly ‘i will tell you mas’r davy’ he said‘wheer all i have been and whatall we have heerd i have been fur and we have heerd little but i will tell you’ i rang the bell for something hot to drink he would have nothing stronger than ale and while it was being brought and being warmed at the fire he sat thinking there was a fine massive gravity in his face i did not venture to disturb ‘when she was a child’ he said lifting up his head soon after we were left alone ‘she used to talk to me a deal about the sea and about them coasts where the sea got to be dark blue and to lay ashining and ashining in the sun i thowt odd times as her father being drownded made her think on it so much i doen’t know you see but maybe she believedor hopedhe had drifted out to them parts where the flowers is always ablowing and the country bright’ ‘it is likely to have been a childish fancy’ i replied ‘when she waslost’ said mr peggotty ‘i know’d in my mind as he would take her to them countries i know’d in my mind as he would have told her wonders of ‘them and how she was to be a lady theer and how he got her to listen to him fust along of sech like when we see his mother i know’d quite well as i was right i went acrosschannel to france and landed theer as if i would fell down from the sky’ i saw the door move and the snow drift in i saw it move a little more and a hand softly interpose to keep it open ‘i found out an english gen’leman as was in authority’ said mr peggotty ‘and told him i was agoing to seek my niece he got me them papers as i wanted fur to carry me throughi doen’t rightly know how they are calledand he would have give me money but that i was thankful to have no need on i thank him kind for all he done i am sure “i have wrote afore you” he says to me “and i shall speak to many as will come that way and many will know you fur distant from here when you are atravelling alone” i told him best as i was able what my gratitoode was and went away through france’ ‘alone and on foot’ said i ‘mostly afoot’ he rejoined ‘sometimes in carts along with people going to market sometimes in empty coaches many mile a day afoot and often with some poor soldier or another travelling to see his friends i could not talk to him’ said mr peggotty ‘nor he to me but we was company for one another too along the dusty roads’ i should have known that by his friendly tone ‘when i come to any town’ he pursued ‘i found the inn and waited about the yard till someone turned up someone mostly did as know’d english then i told how that i was on my way to seek my niece and they told me what manner of gentlefolks was in the house and i waited to see any as seemed like her going in or out when it warn’t them’ly i went on agen by little and little when i come to a new village or that among the poor people i found they know’d about me they would set me down at their cottage doors and give me whatnot fur to eat and drink and show me where to sleep and many a woman mas’r davy as has had a daughter of about them’ly’s age i have found awaiting fur me at our saviour’s cross outside the village fur to do me sim’lar kindnesses some has had daughters as was dead and god only knows how good them mothers was to me’ it was martha at the door i saw her haggard listening face distinctly my dread was lest he should turn his head and see her too ‘they would often put their childrenparticular their little girls’ said mr peggotty ‘upon my knee and many a time you might have seen me sitting at their doors when night was coming in a’most as if they would been my darling’s children oh my darling’ overpowered by sudden grief he sobbed aloud i laid my trembling hand upon the hand he put before his face ‘thankee sir’ he said ‘doen’t take no notice’ in a very little while he took his hand away and put it on his breast and went on with his story ‘they often walked with me’ he said ‘in the morning maybe a mile or two upon my road and when we parted and i said “i am very thankful to you god bless you” they always seemed to understand and answered pleasant at last i come to the sea it warn’t hard you may suppose for a seafaring man like me to work his way over to italy when i got theer i wandered on as i had done afore the people was just as good to me and i should have gone from town to town maybe the country through but that i got news of her being seen among them swiss mountains yonder one as know’d his servant see ‘them there all three and told me how they travelled and where they was i made fur them mountains mas’r davy day and night ever so fur as i went ever so fur the mountains seemed to shift away from me but i come up with ‘them and i crossed ‘them when i got nigh the place as i had been told of i began to think within my own self “what shall i do when i see her”’ the listening face insensible to the inclement night still drooped at the door and the hands begged meprayed menot to cast it forth ‘i never doubted her’ said mr peggotty ‘no not a bit on’y let her see my faceon’y let her heer my voiceon’y let my stanning still afore her bring to her thoughts the home she had fled away from and the child she had beenand if she had growed to be a royal lady she would have fell down at my feet i know’d it well many a time in my sleep had i heerd her cry out “uncle” and seen her fall like death afore me many a time in my sleep had i raised her up and whispered to her “them’ly my dear i am come fur to bring forgiveness and to take you home”’ he stopped and shook his head and went on with a sigh ‘he was nowt to me now them’ly was all i bought a country dress to put upon her and i know’d that once found she would walk beside me over them stony roads go where i would and never never leave me more to put that dress upon her and to cast off what she woreto take her on my arm again and wander towards hometo stop sometimes upon the road and heal her bruised feet and her worsebruised heartwas all that i thowt of now i doen’t believe i should have done so much as look at him but mas’r davy it warn’t to benot yet i was too late and they was gone wheer i could not learn some said heer some said theer i travelled heer and i travelled theer but i found no them’ly and i travelled home’ ‘how long ago’ i asked ‘a matter of fower days’ said mr peggotty ‘i sighted the old boat arter dark and the light ashining in the winder when i come nigh and looked in through the glass i see the faithful creetur missis gummidge sittin’ by the fire as we had fixed upon alone i called out “doen’t be afeerd it is dan’l” and i went in i never could have thowt the old boat would have been so strange’ from some pocket in his breast he took out with a very careful hand a small paper bundle containing two or three letters or little packets which he laid upon the table ‘this fust one come’ he said selecting it from the rest ‘afore i had been gone a week a fifty pound bank note in a sheet of paper directed to me and put underneath the door in the night she tried to hide her writing but she could not hide it from me’ he folded up the note again with great patience and care in exactly the same form and laid it on one side ‘this come to missis gummidge’ he said opening another ‘two or three months ago’ after looking at it for some moments he gave it to me and added in a low voice ‘be so good as read it sir’ i read as follows ‘oh what will you feel when you see this writing and know it comes from my wicked hand but try trynot for my sake but for uncle’s goodness try to let your heart soften to me only for a little little time try pray do to relent towards a miserable girl and write down on a bit of paper whether he is well and what he said about me before you left off ever naming me among yourselvesand whether of a night when it is my old time of coming home you ever see him look as if he thought of one he used to love so dear oh my heart is breaking when i think about it i am kneeling down to you begging and praying you not to be as hard with me as i deserveas i well well know i deservebut to be so gentle and so good as to write down something of him and to send it to me you need not call me little you need not call me by the name i have disgraced but oh listen to my agony and have mercy on me so far as to write me some word of uncle never never to be seen in this world by my eyes again ‘dear if your heart is hard towards mejustly hard i knowbut listen if it is hard dear ask him i have wronged the mosthim whose wife i was to have beenbefore you quite decide against my poor poor prayer if he should be so compassionate as to say that you might write something for me to readi think he would oh i think he would if you would only ask him for he always was so brave and so forgivingtell him then but not else that when i hear the wind blowing at night i feel as if it was passing angrily from seeing him and uncle and was going up to god against me tell him that if i was to die tomorrow and oh if i was fit i would be so glad to die i would bless him and uncle with my last words and pray for his happy home with my last breath’ some money was enclosed in this letter also five pounds it was untouched like the previous sum and he refolded it in the same way detailed instructions were added relative to the address of a reply which although they betrayed the intervention of several hands and made it difficult to arrive at any very probable conclusion in reference to her place of concealment made it at least not unlikely that she had written from that spot where she was stated to have been seen ‘what answer was sent’ i inquired of mr peggotty ‘missis gummidge’ he returned ‘not being a good scholar sir ham kindly drawed it out and she made a copy on it they told her i was gone to seek her and what my parting words was’ ‘is that another letter in your hand’ said i ‘it is money sir’ said mr peggotty unfolding it a little way ‘ten pound you see and wrote inside “from a true friend” like the fust but the fust was put underneath the door and this come by the post day afore yesterday i am agoing to seek her at the postmark’ he showed it to me it was a town on the upper rhine he had found out at yarmouth some foreign dealers who knew that country and they had drawn him a rude map on paper which he could very well understand he laid it between us on the table and with his chin resting on one hand tracked his course upon it with the other i asked him how ham was he shook his head ‘he works’ he said ‘as bold as a man can his name’s as good in all that part as any man’s is anywheres in the wureld anyone’s hand is ready to help him you understand and his is ready to help them he is never been heerd fur to complain but my sister’s belief is ‘twixt ourselves as it has cut him deep’ ‘poor fellow i can believe it’ ‘he are not no care mas’r davy’ said mr peggotty in a solemn whisper‘kinder no care nohow for his life when a man’s wanted for rough sarvice in rough weather he is theer when there is hard duty to be done with danger in it he steps for’ard afore all his mates and yet he is as gentle as any child there are not a child in yarmouth that doen’t know him’ he gathered up the letters thoughtfully smoothing them with his hand put them into their little bundle and placed it tenderly in his breast again the face was gone from the door i still saw the snow drifting in but nothing else was there ‘well’ he said looking to his bag ‘having seen you tonight mas’r davy and that doos me good i shall away betimes tomorrow morning you have seen what i have got heer’ putting his hand on where the little packet lay ‘all that troubles me is to think that any harm might come to me afore that money was give back if i was to die and it was lost or stole or elseways made away with and it was never know’d by him but what i would took it i believe the t’other wureld would not hold me i believe i must come back’ he rose and i rose too we grasped each other by the hand again before going out ‘i would go ten thousand mile’ he said ‘i would go till i dropped dead to lay that money down afore him if i do that and find my them’ly i am content if i doen’t find her maybe she will come to hear sometime as her loving uncle only ended his search for her when he ended his life and if i know her even that will turn her home at last’ as he went out into the rigorous night i saw the lonely figure flit away before us i turned him hastily on some pretence and held him in conversation until it was gone he spoke of a traveller’s house on the dover road where he knew he could find a clean plain lodging for the night i went with him over westminster bridge and parted from him on the surrey shore everything seemed to my imagination to be hushed in reverence for him as he resumed his solitary journey through the snow i returned to the inn yard and impressed by my remembrance of the face looked awfully around for it it was not there the snow had covered our late footprints my new track was the only one to be seen and even that began to die away it snowed so fast as i looked back over my shoulder
