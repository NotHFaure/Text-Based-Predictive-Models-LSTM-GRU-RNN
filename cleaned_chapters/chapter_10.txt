i become neglected and am provided for the first act of business miss murdstone performed when the day of the solemnity was over and light was freely admitted into the house was to give peggotty a month’s warning much as peggotty would have disliked such a service i believe she would have retained it for my sake in preference to the best upon earth she told me we must part and told me why and we condoled with one another in all sincerity as to me or my future not a word was said or a step taken happy they would have been i dare say if they could have dismissed me at a month’s warning too i mustered courage once to ask miss murdstone when i was going back to school and she answered dryly she believed i was not going back at all i was told nothing more i was very anxious to know what was going to be done with me and so was peggotty but neither she nor i could pick up any information on the subject there was one change in my condition which while it relieved me of a great deal of present uneasiness might have made me if i had been capable of considering it closely yet more uncomfortable about the future it was this the constraint that had been put upon me was quite abandoned i was so far from being required to keep my dull post in the parlour that on several occasions when i took my seat there miss murdstone frowned to me to go away i was so far from being warned off from peggotty’s society that provided i was not in mr murdstone’s i was never sought out or inquired for at first i was in daily dread of his taking my education in hand again or of miss murdstone’s devoting herself to it but i soon began to think that such fears were groundless and that all i had to anticipate was neglect i do not conceive that this discovery gave me much pain then i was still giddy with the shock of my mother’s death and in a kind of stunned state as to all tributary things i can recollect indeed to have speculated at odd times on the possibility of my not being taught any more or cared for any more and growing up to be a shabby moody man lounging an idle life away about the village as well as on the feasibility of my getting rid of this picture by going away somewhere like the hero in a story to seek my fortune but these were transient visions daydreams i sat looking at sometimes as if they were faintly painted or written on the wall of my room and which as they melted away left the wall blank again ‘peggotty’ i said in a thoughtful whisper one evening when i was warming my hands at the kitchen fire ‘mr murdstone likes me less than he used to he never liked me much peggotty but he would rather not even see me now if he can help it’ ‘perhaps it is his sorrow’ said peggotty stroking my hair ‘i am sure peggotty i am sorry too if i believed it was his sorrow i should not think of it at all but it is not that oh no it is not that’ ‘how do you know it is not that’ said peggotty after a silence ‘oh his sorrow is another and quite a different thing he is sorry at this moment sitting by the fireside with miss murdstone but if i was to go in peggotty he would be something besides’ ‘what would he be’ said peggotty ‘angry’ i answered with an involuntary imitation of his dark frown ‘if he was only sorry he would not look at me as he does i am only sorry and it makes me feel kinder’ peggotty said nothing for a little while and i warmed my hands as silent as she ‘davy’ she said at length ‘yes peggotty’ ‘i have tried my dear all ways i could think ofall the ways there are and all the ways there are not in shortto get a suitable service here in blunderstone but there is no such a thing my love’ ‘and what do you mean to do peggotty’ says i wistfully ‘do you mean to go and seek your fortune’ ‘i expect i shall be forced to go to yarmouth’ replied peggotty ‘and live there’ ‘you might have gone farther off’ i said brightening a little ‘and been as bad as lost i shall see you sometimes my dear old peggotty there you will not be quite at the other end of the world will you’ ‘contrary ways please god’ cried peggotty with great animation ‘as long as you are here my pet i shall come over every week of my life to see you one day every week of my life’ i felt a great weight taken off my mind by this promise but even this was not all for peggotty went on to say ‘i am agoing davy you see to my brother’s first for another fortnight’s visitjust till i have had time to look about me and get to be something like myself again now i have been thinking that perhaps as they do not want you here at present you might be let to go along with me’ if anything short of being in a different relation to every one about me peggotty excepted could have given me a sense of pleasure at that time it would have been this project of all others the idea of being again surrounded by those honest faces shining welcome on me of renewing the peacefulness of the sweet sunday morning when the bells were ringing the stones dropping in the water and the shadowy ships breaking through the mist of roaming up and down with little them’ly telling her my troubles and finding charms against them in the shells and pebbles on the beach made a calm in my heart it was ruffled next moment to be sure by a doubt of miss murdstone’s giving her consent but even that was set at rest soon for she came out to take an evening grope in the storecloset while we were yet in conversation and peggotty with a boldness that amazed me broached the topic on the spot ‘the boy will be idle there’ said miss murdstone looking into a picklejar ‘and idleness is the root of all evil but to be sure he would be idle hereor anywhere in my opinion’ peggotty had an angry answer ready i could see but she swallowed it for my sake and remained silent ‘humph’ said miss murdstone still keeping her eye on the pickles ‘it is of more importance than anything elseit is of paramount importancethat my brother should not be disturbed or made uncomfortable i suppose i had better say yes’ i thanked her without making any demonstration of joy lest it should induce her to withdraw her assent nor could i help thinking this a prudent course since she looked at me out of the picklejar with as great an access of sourness as if her black eyes had absorbed its contents however the permission was given and was never retracted for when the month was out peggotty and i were ready to depart mr barkis came into the house for peggotty’s boxes i had never known him to pass the gardengate before but on this occasion he came into the house and he gave me a look as he shouldered the largest box and went out which i thought had meaning in it if meaning could ever be said to find its way into mr barkis’s visage peggotty was naturally in low spirits at leaving what had been her home so many years and where the two strong attachments of her lifefor my mother and myselfhad been formed she had been walking in the churchyard too very early and she got into the cart and sat in it with her handkerchief at her eyes so long as she remained in this condition mr barkis gave no sign of life whatever he sat in his usual place and attitude like a great stuffed figure but when she began to look about her and to speak to me he nodded his head and grinned several times i have not the least notion at whom or what he meant by it ‘it is a beautiful day mr barkis’ i said as an act of politeness ‘it are not bad’ said mr barkis who generally qualified his speech and rarely committed himself ‘peggotty is quite comfortable now mr barkis’ i remarked for his satisfaction ‘is she though’ said mr barkis after reflecting about it with a sagacious air mr barkis eyed her and said ‘are you pretty comfortable’ peggotty laughed and answered in the affirmative ‘but really and truly you know are you’ growled mr barkis sliding nearer to her on the seat and nudging her with his elbow ‘are you really and truly pretty comfortable are you eh’ at each of these inquiries mr barkis shuffled nearer to her and gave her another nudge so that at last we were all crowded together in the lefthand corner of the cart and i was so squeezed that i could hardly bear it peggotty calling his attention to my sufferings mr barkis gave me a little more room at once and got away by degrees but i could not help observing that he seemed to think he had hit upon a wonderful expedient for expressing himself in a neat agreeable and pointed manner without the inconvenience of inventing conversation he manifestly chuckled over it for some time by and by he turned to peggotty again and repeating ‘are you pretty comfortable though’ bore down upon us as before until the breath was nearly edged out of my body by and by he made another descent upon us with the same inquiry and the same result at length i got up whenever i saw him coming and standing on the footboard pretended to look at the prospect after which i did very well he was so polite as to stop at a publichouse expressly on our account and entertain us with broiled mutton and beer even when peggotty was in the act of drinking he was seized with one of those approaches and almost choked her but as we drew nearer to the end of our journey he had more to do and less time for gallantry and when we got on yarmouth pavement we were all too much shaken and jolted i apprehend to have any leisure for anything else mr peggotty and ham waited for us at the old place they received me and peggotty in an affectionate manner and shook hands with mr barkis who with his hat on the very back of his head and a shamefaced leer upon his countenance and pervading his very legs presented but a vacant appearance i thought they each took one of peggotty’s trunks and we were going away when mr barkis solemnly made a sign to me with his forefinger to come under an archway ‘i say’ growled mr barkis ‘it was all right’ i looked up into his face and answered with an attempt to be very profound ‘oh’ ‘it did not come to a end there’ said mr barkis nodding confidentially ‘it was all right’ again i answered ‘oh’ ‘you know who was willin’’ said my friend ‘it was barkis and barkis only’ i nodded assent ‘it is all right’ said mr barkis shaking hands ‘i am a friend of your’n you made it all right first it is all right’ in his attempts to be particularly lucid mr barkis was so extremely mysterious that i might have stood looking in his face for an hour and most assuredly should have got as much information out of it as out of the face of a clock that had stopped but for peggotty’s calling me away as we were going along she asked me what he had said and i told her he had said it was all right ‘like his impudence’ said peggotty ‘but i do not mind that davy dear what should you think if i was to think of being married’ ‘whyi suppose you would like me as much then peggotty as you do now’ i returned after a little consideration greatly to the astonishment of the passengers in the street as well as of her relations going on before the good soul was obliged to stop and embrace me on the spot with many protestations of her unalterable love ‘tell me what should you say darling’ she asked again when this was over and we were walking on ‘if you were thinking of being marriedto mr barkis peggotty’ ‘yes’ said peggotty ‘i should think it would be a very good thing for then you know peggotty you would always have the horse and cart to bring you over to see me and could come for nothing and be sure of coming’ ‘the sense of the dear’ cried peggotty ‘what i have been thinking of this month back yes my precious and i think i should be more independent altogether you see let alone my working with a better heart in my own house than i could in anybody else’s now i do not know what i might be fit for now as a servant to a stranger and i shall be always near my pretty’s restingplace’ said peggotty musing ‘and be able to see it when i like and when i lie down to rest i may be laid not far off from my darling girl’ we neither of us said anything for a little while ‘but i would not so much as give it another thought’ said peggotty cheerily ‘if my davy was anyways against itnot if i had been asked in church thirty times three times over and was wearing out the ring in my pocket’ ‘look at me peggotty’ i replied ‘and see if i am not really glad and do not truly wish it’ as indeed i did with all my heart ‘well my life’ said peggotty giving me a squeeze ‘i have thought of it night and day every way i can and i hope the right way but i will think of it again and speak to my brother about it and in the meantime we will keep it to ourselves davy you and me barkis is a good plain creature’ said peggotty ‘and if i tried to do my duty by him i think it would be my fault if i was notif i was not pretty comfortable’ said peggotty laughing heartily this quotation from mr barkis was so appropriate and tickled us both so much that we laughed again and again and were quite in a pleasant humour when we came within view of mr peggotty’s cottage it looked just the same except that it may perhaps have shrunk a little in my eyes and mrs gummidge was waiting at the door as if she had stood there ever since all within was the same down to the seaweed in the blue mug in my bedroom i went into the outhouse to look about me and the very same lobsters crabs and crawfish possessed by the same desire to pinch the world in general appeared to be in the same state of conglomeration in the same old corner but there was no little them’ly to be seen so i asked mr peggotty where she was ‘she is at school sir’ said mr peggotty wiping the heat consequent on the porterage of peggotty’s box from his forehead ‘she will be home’ looking at the dutch clock ‘in from twenty minutes to halfanhour’s time we all on us feel the loss of her bless ye’ mrs gummidge moaned ‘cheer up mawther’ cried mr peggotty ‘i feel it more than anybody else’ said mrs gummidge ‘i am a lone lorn creetur’ and she used to be a’most the only thing that did not go contrary with me’ mrs gummidge whimpering and shaking her head applied herself to blowing the fire mr peggotty looking round upon us while she was so engaged said in a low voice which he shaded with his hand ‘the old ‘un’ from this i rightly conjectured that no improvement had taken place since my last visit in the state of mrs gummidge’s spirits now the whole place was or it should have been quite as delightful a place as ever and yet it did not impress me in the same way i felt rather disappointed with it perhaps it was because little them’ly was not at home i knew the way by which she would come and presently found myself strolling along the path to meet her a figure appeared in the distance before long and i soon knew it to be them’ly who was a little creature still in stature though she was grown but when she drew nearer and i saw her blue eyes looking bluer and her dimpled face looking brighter and her whole self prettier and gayer a curious feeling came over me that made me pretend not to know her and pass by as if i were looking at something a long way off i have done such a thing since in later life or i am mistaken little them’ly did not care a bit she saw me well enough but instead of turning round and calling after me ran away laughing this obliged me to run after her and she ran so fast that we were very near the cottage before i caught her ‘oh it is you is it’ said little them’ly ‘why you knew who it was them’ly’ said i ‘and did not you know who it was’ said them’ly i was going to kiss her but she covered her cherry lips with her hands and said she was not a baby now and ran away laughing more than ever into the house she seemed to delight in teasing me which was a change in her i wondered at very much the tea table was ready and our little locker was put out in its old place but instead of coming to sit by me she went and bestowed her company upon that grumbling mrs gummidge and on mr peggotty’s inquiring why rumpled her hair all over her face to hide it and could do nothing but laugh ‘a little puss it is’ said mr peggotty patting her with his great hand ‘so sh’ is so sh’ is’ cried ham ‘mas’r davy bor’ so sh’ is’ and he sat and chuckled at her for some time in a state of mingled admiration and delight that made his face a burning red little them’ly was spoiled by them all in fact and by no one more than mr peggotty himself whom she could have coaxed into anything by only going and laying her cheek against his rough whisker that was my opinion at least when i saw her do it and i held mr peggotty to be thoroughly in the right but she was so affectionate and sweetnatured and had such a pleasant manner of being both sly and shy at once that she captivated me more than ever she was tenderhearted too for when as we sat round the fire after tea an allusion was made by mr peggotty over his pipe to the loss i had sustained the tears stood in her eyes and she looked at me so kindly across the table that i felt quite thankful to her ‘ah’ said mr peggotty taking up her curls and running them over his hand like water ‘here is another orphan you see sir and here’ said mr peggotty giving ham a backhanded knock in the chest ‘is another of ‘them though he do not look much like it’ ‘if i had you for my guardian mr peggotty’ said i shaking my head ‘i do not think i should feel much like it’ ‘well said mas’r davy bor’’ cried ham in an ecstasy ‘hoorah well said nor more you would not hor hor’here he returned mr peggotty’s backhander and little them’ly got up and kissed mr peggotty ‘and how is your friend sir’ said mr peggotty to me ‘steerforth’ said i ‘that is the name’ cried mr peggotty turning to ham ‘i knowed it was something in our way’ ‘you said it was rudderford’ observed ham laughing ‘well’ retorted mr peggotty ‘and ye steer with a rudder do not ye it are not fur off how is he sir’ ‘he was very well indeed when i came away mr peggotty’ ‘there is a friend’ said mr peggotty stretching out his pipe ‘there is a friend if you talk of friends why lord love my heart alive if it are not a treat to look at him’ ‘he is very handsome is he not’ said i my heart warming with this praise ‘handsome’ cried mr peggotty ‘he stands up to you likelike awhy i do not know what he do not stand up to you like he is so bold’ ‘yes that is just his character’ said i ‘he is as brave as a lion and you cannot think how frank he is mr peggotty’ ‘and i do suppose now’ said mr peggotty looking at me through the smoke of his pipe ‘that in the way of booklarning he would take the wind out of a’most anything’ ‘yes’ said i delighted ‘he knows everything he is astonishingly clever’ ‘there is a friend’ murmured mr peggotty with a grave toss of his head ‘nothing seems to cost him any trouble’ said i ‘he knows a task if he only looks at it he is the best cricketer you ever saw he will give you almost as many men as you like at draughts and beat you easily’ mr peggotty gave his head another toss as much as to say ‘of course he will’ ‘he is such a speaker’ i pursued ‘that he can win anybody over and i do not know what you would say if you were to hear him sing mr peggotty’ mr peggotty gave his head another toss as much as to say ‘i have no doubt of it’ ‘then he is such a generous fine noble fellow’ said i quite carried away by my favourite theme ‘that it is hardly possible to give him as much praise as he deserves i am sure i can never feel thankful enough for the generosity with which he has protected me so much younger and lower in the school than himself’ i was running on very fast indeed when my eyes rested on little them’ly’s face which was bent forward over the table listening with the deepest attention her breath held her blue eyes sparkling like jewels and the colour mantling in her cheeks she looked so extraordinarily earnest and pretty that i stopped in a sort of wonder and they all observed her at the same time for as i stopped they laughed and looked at her ‘them’ly is like me’ said peggotty ‘and would like to see him’ them’ly was confused by our all observing her and hung down her head and her face was covered with blushes glancing up presently through her stray curls and seeing that we were all looking at her still i am sure i for one could have looked at her for hours she ran away and kept away till it was nearly bedtime i lay down in the old little bed in the stern of the boat and the wind came moaning on across the flat as it had done before but i could not help fancying now that it moaned of those who were gone and instead of thinking that the sea might rise in the night and float the boat away i thought of the sea that had risen since i last heard those sounds and drowned my happy home i recollect as the wind and water began to sound fainter in my ears putting a short clause into my prayers petitioning that i might grow up to marry little them’ly and so dropping lovingly asleep the days passed pretty much as they had passed before exceptit was a great exceptionthat little them’ly and i seldom wandered on the beach now she had tasks to learn and needlework to do and was absent during a great part of each day but i felt that we should not have had those old wanderings even if it had been otherwise wild and full of childish whims as them’ly was she was more of a little woman than i had supposed she seemed to have got a great distance away from me in little more than a year she liked me but she laughed at me and tormented me and when i went to meet her stole home another way and was laughing at the door when i came back disappointed the best times were when she sat quietly at work in the doorway and i sat on the wooden step at her feet reading to her it seems to me at this hour that i have never seen such sunlight as on those bright april afternoons that i have never seen such a sunny little figure as i used to see sitting in the doorway of the old boat that i have never beheld such sky such water such glorified ships sailing away into golden air on the very first evening after our arrival mr barkis appeared in an exceedingly vacant and awkward condition and with a bundle of oranges tied up in a handkerchief as he made no allusion of any kind to this property he was supposed to have left it behind him by accident when he went away until ham running after him to restore it came back with the information that it was intended for peggotty after that occasion he appeared every evening at exactly the same hour and always with a little bundle to which he never alluded and which he regularly put behind the door and left there these offerings of affection were of a most various and eccentric description among them i remember a double set of pigs’ trotters a huge pincushion half a bushel or so of apples a pair of jet earrings some spanish onions a box of dominoes a canary bird and cage and a leg of pickled pork mr barkis’s wooing as i remember it was altogether of a peculiar kind he very seldom said anything but would sit by the fire in much the same attitude as he sat in his cart and stare heavily at peggotty who was opposite one night being as i suppose inspired by love he made a dart at the bit of waxcandle she kept for her thread and put it in his waistcoatpocket and carried it off after that his great delight was to produce it when it was wanted sticking to the lining of his pocket in a partially melted state and pocket it again when it was done with he seemed to enjoy himself very much and not to feel at all called upon to talk even when he took peggotty out for a walk on the flats he had no uneasiness on that head i believe contenting himself with now and then asking her if she was pretty comfortable and i remember that sometimes after he was gone peggotty would throw her apron over her face and laugh for halfanhour indeed we were all more or less amused except that miserable mrs gummidge whose courtship would appear to have been of an exactly parallel nature she was so continually reminded by these transactions of the old one at length when the term of my visit was nearly expired it was given out that peggotty and mr barkis were going to make a day’s holiday together and that little them’ly and i were to accompany them i had but a broken sleep the night before in anticipation of the pleasure of a whole day with them’ly we were all astir betimes in the morning and while we were yet at breakfast mr barkis appeared in the distance driving a chaisecart towards the object of his affections peggotty was dressed as usual in her neat and quiet mourning but mr barkis bloomed in a new blue coat of which the tailor had given him such good measure that the cuffs would have rendered gloves unnecessary in the coldest weather while the collar was so high that it pushed his hair up on end on the top of his head his bright buttons too were of the largest size rendered complete by drab pantaloons and a buff waistcoat i thought mr barkis a phenomenon of respectability when we were all in a bustle outside the door i found that mr peggotty was prepared with an old shoe which was to be thrown after us for luck and which he offered to mrs gummidge for that purpose ‘no it had better be done by somebody else dan’l’ said mrs gummidge ‘i am a lone lorn creetur’ myself and everythink that reminds me of creetur’s that are not lone and lorn goes contrary with me’ ‘come old gal’ cried mr peggotty ‘take and heave it’ ‘no dan’l’ returned mrs gummidge whimpering and shaking her head ‘if i felt less i could do more you do not feel like me dan’l thinks do not go contrary with you nor you with them you had better do it yourself’ but here peggotty who had been going about from one to another in a hurried way kissing everybody called out from the cart in which we all were by this time them’ly and i on two little chairs side by side that mrs gummidge must do it so mrs gummidge did it and i am sorry to relate cast a damp upon the festive character of our departure by immediately bursting into tears and sinking subdued into the arms of ham with the declaration that she knowed she was a burden and had better be carried to the house at once which i really thought was a sensible idea that ham might have acted on away we went however on our holiday excursion and the first thing we did was to stop at a church where mr barkis tied the horse to some rails and went in with peggotty leaving little them’ly and me alone in the chaise i took that occasion to put my arm round them’ly’s waist and propose that as i was going away so very soon now we should determine to be very affectionate to one another and very happy all day little them’ly consenting and allowing me to kiss her i became desperate informing her i recollect that i never could love another and that i was prepared to she would the blood of anybody who should aspire to her affections how merry little them’ly made herself about it with what a demure assumption of being immensely older and wiser than i the fairy little woman said i was ‘a silly boy’ and then laughed so charmingly that i forgot the pain of being called by that disparaging name in the pleasure of looking at her mr barkis and peggotty were a good while in the church but came out at last and then we drove away into the country as we were going along mr barkis turned to me and said with a winkby the by i should hardly have thought before that he could wink ‘what name was it as i wrote up in the cart’ ‘clara peggotty’ i answered ‘what name would it be as i should write up now if there was a tilt here’ ‘clara peggotty again’ i suggested ‘clara peggotty barkis’ he returned and burst into a roar of laughter that shook the chaise in a word they were married and had gone into the church for no other purpose peggotty was resolved that it should be quietly done and the clerk had given her away and there had been no witnesses of the ceremony she was a little confused when mr barkis made this abrupt announcement of their union and could not hug me enough in token of her unimpaired affection but she soon became herself again and said she was very glad it was over we drove to a little inn in a byroad where we were expected and where we had a very comfortable dinner and passed the day with great satisfaction if peggotty had been married every day for the last ten years she could hardly have been more at her ease about it it made no sort of difference in her she was just the same as ever and went out for a stroll with little them’ly and me before tea while mr barkis philosophically smoked his pipe and enjoyed himself i suppose with the contemplation of his happiness if so it sharpened his appetite for i distinctly call to mind that although he had eaten a good deal of pork and greens at dinner and had finished off with a fowl or two he was obliged to have cold boiled bacon for tea and disposed of a large quantity without any emotion i have often thought since what an odd innocent outoftheway kind of wedding it must have been we got into the chaise again soon after dark and drove cosily back looking up at the stars and talking about them i was their chief exponent and opened mr barkis’s mind to an amazing extent i told him all i knew but he would have believed anything i might have taken it into my head to impart to him for he had a profound veneration for my abilities and informed his wife in my hearing on that very occasion that i was ‘a young roeshus’by which i think he meant prodigy when we had exhausted the subject of the stars or rather when i had exhausted the mental faculties of mr barkis little them’ly and i made a cloak of an old wrapper and sat under it for the rest of the journey ah how i loved her what happiness i thought if we were married and were going away anywhere to live among the trees and in the fields never growing older never growing wiser children ever rambling hand in hand through sunshine and among flowery meadows laying down our heads on moss at night in a sweet sleep of purity and peace and buried by the birds when we were dead some such picture with no real world in it bright with the light of our innocence and vague as the stars afar off was in my mind all the way i am glad to think there were two such guileless hearts at peggotty’s marriage as little them’ly’s and mine i am glad to think the loves and graces took such airy forms in its homely procession well we came to the old boat again in good time at night and there mr and mrs barkis bade us goodbye and drove away snugly to their own home i felt then for the first time that i had lost peggotty i should have gone to bed with a sore heart indeed under any other roof but that which sheltered little them’ly’s head mr peggotty and ham knew what was in my thoughts as well as i did and were ready with some supper and their hospitable faces to drive it away little them’ly came and sat beside me on the locker for the only time in all that visit and it was altogether a wonderful close to a wonderful day it was a night tide and soon after we went to bed mr peggotty and ham went out to fish i felt very brave at being left alone in the solitary house the protector of them’ly and mrs gummidge and only wished that a lion or a serpent or any illdisposed monster would make an attack upon us that i might destroy him and cover myself with glory but as nothing of the sort happened to be walking about on yarmouth flats that night i provided the best substitute i could by dreaming of dragons until morning with morning came peggotty who called to me as usual under my window as if mr barkis the carrier had been from first to last a dream too after breakfast she took me to her own home and a beautiful little home it was of all the moveables in it i must have been impressed by a certain old bureau of some dark wood in the parlour the tilefloored kitchen was the general sittingroom with a retreating top which opened let down and became a desk within which was a large quarto edition of foxe’s book of martyrs this precious volume of which i do not recollect one word i immediately discovered and immediately applied myself to and i never visited the house afterwards but i kneeled on a chair opened the casket where this gem was enshrined spread my arms over the desk and fell to devouring the book afresh i was chiefly edified i am afraid by the pictures which were numerous and represented all kinds of dismal horrors but the martyrs and peggotty’s house have been inseparable in my mind ever since and are now i took leave of mr peggotty and ham and mrs gummidge and little them’ly that day and passed the night at peggotty’s in a little room in the roof with the crocodile book on a shelf by the bed’s head which was to be always mine peggotty said and should always be kept for me in exactly the same state ‘young or old davy dear as long as i am alive and have this house over my head’ said peggotty ‘you shall find it as if i expected you here directly minute i shall keep it every day as i used to keep your old little room my darling and if you was to go to china you might think of it as being kept just the same all the time you were away’ i felt the truth and constancy of my dear old nurse with all my heart and thanked her as well as i could that was not very well for she spoke to me thus with her arms round my neck in the morning and i was going home in the morning and i went home in the morning with herself and mr barkis in the cart they left me at the gate not easily or lightly and it was a strange sight to me to see the cart go on taking peggotty away and leaving me under the old elmtrees looking at the house in which there was no face to look on mine with love or liking any more and now i fell into a state of neglect which i cannot look back upon without compassion i fell at once into a solitary conditionapart from all friendly notice apart from the society of all other boys of my own age apart from all companionship but my own spiritless thoughtswhich seems to cast its gloom upon this paper as i write what would i have given to have been sent to the hardest school that ever was keptto have been taught something anyhow anywhere no such hope dawned upon me they disliked me and they sullenly sternly steadily overlooked me i think mr murdstone’s means were straitened at about this time but it is little to the purpose he could not bear me and in putting me from him he tried as i believe to put away the notion that i had any claim upon himand succeeded i was not actively illused i was not beaten or starved but the wrong that was done to me had no intervals of relenting and was done in a systematic passionless manner day after day week after week month after month i was coldly neglected i wonder sometimes when i think of it what they would have done if i had been taken with an illness whether i should have lain down in my lonely room and languished through it in my usual solitary way or whether anybody would have helped me out when mr and miss murdstone were at home i took my meals with them in their absence i ate and drank by myself at all times i lounged about the house and neighbourhood quite disregarded except that they were jealous of my making any friends thinking perhaps that if i did i might complain to someone for this reason though mr chillip often asked me to go and see him he was a widower having some years before that lost a little small lighthaired wife whom i can just remember connecting in my own thoughts with a pale tortoiseshe will cat it was but seldom that i enjoyed the happiness of passing an afternoon in his closet of a surgery reading some book that was new to me with the smell of the whole pharmacopoeia coming up my nose or pounding something in a mortar under his mild directions for the same reason added no doubt to the old dislike of her i was seldom allowed to visit peggotty faithful to her promise she either came to see me or met me somewhere near once every week and never emptyhanded but many and bitter were the disappointments i had in being refused permission to pay a visit to her at her house some few times however at long intervals i was allowed to go there and then i found out that mr barkis was something of a miser or as peggotty dutifully expressed it was ‘a little near’ and kept a heap of money in a box under his bed which he pretended was only full of coats and trousers in this coffer his riches hid themselves with such a tenacious modesty that the smallest instalments could only be tempted out by artifice so that peggotty had to prepare a long and elaborate scheme a very gunpowder plot for every saturday’s expenses all this time i was so conscious of the waste of any promise i had given and of my being utterly neglected that i should have been perfectly miserable i have no doubt but for the old books they were my only comfort and i was as true to them as they were to me and read them over and over i do not know how many times more i now approach a period of my life which i can never lose the remembrance of while i remember anything and the recollection of which has often without my invocation come before me like a ghost and haunted happier times i had been out one day loitering somewhere in the listless meditative manner that my way of life engendered when turning the corner of a lane near our house i came upon mr murdstone walking with a gentleman i was confused and was going by them when the gentleman cried ‘what brooks’ ‘no sir david copperfield’ i said ‘do not tell me you are brooks’ said the gentleman ‘you are brooks of sheffield that is your name’ at these words i observed the gentleman more attentively his laugh coming to my remembrance too i knew him to be mr quinion whom i had gone over to lowestoft with mr murdstone to see beforeit is no matteri need not recall when ‘and how do you get on and where are you being educated brooks’ said mr quinion he had put his hand upon my shoulder and turned me about to walk with them i did not know what to reply and glanced dubiously at mr murdstone ‘he is at home at present’ said the latter ‘he is not being educated anywhere i do not know what to do with him he is a difficult subject’ that old double look was on me for a moment and then his eyes darkened with a frown as it turned in its aversion elsewhere ‘humph’ said mr quinion looking at us both i thought ‘fine weather’ silence ensued and i was considering how i could best disengage my shoulder from his hand and go away when he said ‘i suppose you are a pretty sharp fellow still eh brooks’ ‘aye he is sharp enough’ said mr murdstone impatiently ‘you had better let him go he will not thank you for troubling him’ on this hint mr quinion released me and i made the best of my way home looking back as i turned into the front garden i saw mr murdstone leaning against the wicket of the churchyard and mr quinion talking to him they were both looking after me and i felt that they were speaking of me mr quinion lay at our house that night after breakfast the next morning i had put my chair away and was going out of the room when mr murdstone called me back he then gravely repaired to another table where his sister sat herself at her desk mr quinion with his hands in his pockets stood looking out of window and i stood looking at them all ‘david’ said mr murdstone ‘to the young this is a world for action not for moping and droning in’ ‘as you do’ added his sister ‘jane murdstone leave it to me if you please i say david to the young this is a world for action and not for moping and droning in it is especially so for a young boy of your disposition which requires a great deal of correcting and to which no greater service can be done than to force it to conform to the ways of the working world and to bend it and break it’ ‘for stubbornness will not do here’ said his sister ‘what it wants is to be crushed and crushed it must be shall be too’ he gave her a look half in remonstrance half in approval and went on ‘i suppose you know david that i am not rich at any rate you know it now you have received some considerable education already education is costly and even if it were not and i could afford it i am of opinion that it would not be at all advantageous to you to be kept at school what is before you is a fight with the world and the sooner you begin it the better’ i think it occurred to me that i had already begun it in my poor way but it occurs to me now whether or no ‘you have heard the “countinghouse” mentioned sometimes’ said mr murdstone ‘the countinghouse sir’ i repeated ‘of murdstone and grinby in the wine trade’ he replied i suppose i looked uncertain for he went on hastily ‘you have heard the “countinghouse” mentioned or the business or the cellars or the wharf or something about it’ ‘i think i have heard the business mentioned sir’ i said remembering what i vaguely knew of his and his sister’s resources ‘but i do not know when’ ‘it does not matter when’ he returned ‘mr quinion manages that business’ i glanced at the latter deferentially as he stood looking out of window ‘mr quinion suggests that it gives employment to some other boys and that he sees no reason why it should not on the same terms give employment to you’ ‘he having’ mr quinion observed in a low voice and half turning round ‘no other prospect murdstone’ mr murdstone with an impatient even an angry gesture resumed without noticing what he had said ‘those terms are that you will earn enough for yourself to provide for your eating and drinking and pocketmoney your lodging which i have arranged for will be paid by me so will your washing’ ‘which will be kept down to my estimate’ said his sister ‘your clothes will be looked after for you too’ said mr murdstone ‘as you will not be able yet awhile to get them for yourself so you are now going to london david with mr quinion to begin the world on your own account’ ‘in short you are provided for’ observed his sister ‘and will please to do your duty’ though i quite understood that the purpose of this announcement was to get rid of me i have no distinct remembrance whether it pleased or frightened me my impression is that i was in a state of confusion about it and oscillating between the two points touched neither nor had i much time for the clearing of my thoughts as mr quinion was to go upon the morrow behold me on the morrow in a muchworn little white hat with a black crape round it for my mother a black jacket and a pair of hard stiff corduroy trouserswhich miss murdstone considered the best armour for the legs in that fight with the world which was now to come off behold me so attired and with my little worldly all before me in a small trunk sitting a lone lorn child as mrs gummidge might have said in the postchaise that was carrying mr quinion to the london coach at yarmouth see how our house and church are lessening in the distance how the grave beneath the tree is blotted out by intervening objects how the spire points upwards from my old playground no more and the sky is empty
