i am shown two interesting penitents for a timeat all events until my book should be completed which would be the work of several monthsi took up my abode in my aunt’s house at dover and there sitting in the window from which i had looked out at the moon upon the sea when that roof first gave me shelter i quietly pursued my task in pursuance of my intention of referring to my own fictions only when their course should incidentally connect itself with the progress of my story i do not enter on the aspirations the delights anxieties and triumphs of my art that i truly devoted myself to it with my strongest earnestness and bestowed upon it every energy of my soul i have already said if the books i have written be of any worth they will supply the rest i shall otherwise have written to poor purpose and the rest will be of interest to no one occasionally i went to london to lose myself in the swarm of life there or to consult with traddles on some business point he had managed for me in my absence with the soundest judgement and my worldly affairs were prospering as my notoriety began to bring upon me an enormous quantity of letters from people of whom i had no knowledgechiefly about nothing and extremely difficult to answeri agreed with traddles to have my name painted up on his door there the devoted postman on that beat delivered bushels of letters for me and there at intervals i laboured through them like a home secretary of state without the salary among this correspondence there dropped in every now and then an obliging proposal from one of the numerous outsiders always lurking about the commons to practise under cover of my name if i would take the necessary steps remaining to make a proctor of myself and pay me a percentage on the profits but i declined these offers being already aware that there were plenty of such covert practitioners in existence and considering the commons quite bad enough without my doing anything to make it worse the girls had gone home when my name burst into bloom on traddles’s door and the sharp boy looked all day as if he had never heard of sophy shut up in a back room glancing down from her work into a sooty little strip of garden with a pump in it but there i always found her the same bright housewife often humming her devonshire ballads when no strange foot was coming up the stairs and blunting the sharp boy in his official closet with melody i wondered at first why i so often found sophy writing in a copybook and why she always shut it up when i appeared and hurried it into the tabledrawer but the secret soon came out one day traddles who had just come home through the drizzling sleet from court took a paper out of his desk and asked me what i thought of that handwriting ‘oh do not tom’ cried sophy who was warming his slippers before the fire ‘my dear’ returned tom in a delighted state ‘why not what do you say to that writing copperfield’ ‘it is extraordinarily legal and formal’ said i ‘i do not think i ever saw such a stiff hand’ ‘not like a lady’s hand is it’ said traddles ‘a lady’s’ i repeated ‘bricks and mortar are more like a lady’s hand’ traddles broke into a rapturous laugh and informed me that it was sophy’s writing that sophy had vowed and declared he would need a copyingclerk soon and she would be that clerk that she had acquired this hand from a pattern and that she could throw offi forget how many folios an hour sophy was very much confused by my being told all this and said that when ‘tom’ was made a judge he would not be so ready to proclaim it which ‘tom’ denied averring that he should always be equally proud of it under all circumstances ‘what a thoroughly good and charming wife she is my dear traddles’ said i when she had gone away laughing ‘my dear copperfield’ returned traddles ‘she is without any exception the dearest girl the way she manages this place her punctuality domestic knowledge economy and order her cheerfulness copperfield’ ‘indeed you have reason to commend her’ i returned ‘you are a happy fellow i believe you make yourselves and each other two of the happiest people in the world’ ‘i am sure we are two of the happiest people’ returned traddles ‘i admit that at all events bless my soul when i see her getting up by candlelight on these dark mornings busying herself in the day’s arrangements going out to market before the clerks come into the inn caring for no weather devising the most capital little dinners out of the plainest materials making puddings and pies keeping everything in its right place always so neat and ornamental herself sitting up at night with me if it is ever so late sweettempered and encouraging always and all for me i positively sometimes cannot believe it copperfield’ he was tender of the very slippers she had been warming as he put them on and stretched his feet enjoyingly upon the fender ‘i positively sometimes cannot believe it’ said traddles ‘then our pleasures dear me they are inexpensive but they are quite wonderful when we are at home here of an evening and shut the outer door and draw those curtainswhich she madewhere could we be more snug when it is fine and we go out for a walk in the evening the streets abound in enjoyment for us we look into the glittering windows of the jewellers’ shops and i show sophy which of the diamondeyed serpents coiled up on white satin rising grounds i would give her if i could afford it and sophy shows me which of the gold watches that are capped and jewelled and engineturned and possessed of the horizontal leverescapemovement and all sorts of things she would buy for me if she could afford it and we pick out the spoons and forks fishslices butterknives and sugartongs we should both prefer if we could both afford it and really we go away as if we had got them then when we stroll into the squares and great streets and see a house to let sometimes we look up at it and say how would that do if i was made a judge and we parcel it outsuch a room for us such rooms for the girls and so forth until we settle to our satisfaction that it would do or it would not do as the case may be sometimes we go at halfprice to the pit of the theatrethe very smell of which is cheap in my opinion at the moneyand there we thoroughly enjoy the play which sophy believes every word of and so do i in walking home perhaps we buy a little bit of something at a cook’sshop or a little lobster at the fishmongers and bring it here and make a splendid supper chatting about what we have seen now you know copperfield if i was lord chancellor we could not do this’ ‘you would do something whatever you were my dear traddles’ thought i ‘that would be pleasant and amiable and by the way’ i said aloud ‘i suppose you never draw any skeletons now’ ‘really’ replied traddles laughing and reddening ‘i cannot wholly deny that i do my dear copperfield for being in one of the back rows of the king’s bench the other day with a pen in my hand the fancy came into my head to try how i had preserved that accomplishment and i am afraid there is a skeletonin a wigon the ledge of the desk’ after we had both laughed heartily traddles wound up by looking with a smile at the fire and saying in his forgiving way ‘old creakle’ ‘i have a letter from that oldrascal here’ said i for i never was less disposed to forgive him the way he used to batter traddles than when i saw traddles so ready to forgive him himself ‘from creakle the schoolmaster’ exclaimed traddles ‘no’ ‘among the persons who are attracted to me in my rising fame and fortune’ said i looking over my letters ‘and who discover that they were always much attached to me is the selfsame creakle he is not a schoolmaster now traddles he is retired he is a middlesex magistrate’ i thought traddles might be surprised to hear it but he was not so at all ‘how do you suppose he comes to be a middlesex magistrate’ said i ‘oh dear me’ replied traddles ‘it would be very difficult to answer that question perhaps he voted for somebody or lent money to somebody or bought something of somebody or otherwise obliged somebody or jobbed for somebody who knew somebody who got the lieutenant of the county to nominate him for the commission’ ‘on the commission he is at any rate’ said i ‘and he writes to me here that he will be glad to show me in operation the only true system of prison discipline the only unchallengeable way of making sincere and lasting converts and penitentswhich you know is by solitary confinement what do you say’ ‘to the system’ inquired traddles looking grave ‘no to my accepting the offer and your going with me’ ‘i do not object’ said traddles ‘then i will write to say so you remember to say nothing of our treatment this same creakle turning his son out of doors i suppose and the life he used to lead his wife and daughter’ ‘perfectly’ said traddles ‘yet if you will read his letter you will find he is the tenderest of men to prisoners convicted of the whole calendar of felonies’ said i ‘though i cannot find that his tenderness extends to any other class of created beings’ traddles shrugged his shoulders and was not at all surprised i had not expected him to be and was not surprised myself or my observation of similar practical satires would have been but scanty we arranged the time of our visit and i wrote accordingly to mr creakle that evening on the appointed dayi think it was the next day but no mattertraddles and i repaired to the prison where mr creakle was powerful it was an immense and solid building erected at a vast expense i could not help thinking as we approached the gate what an uproar would have been made in the country if any deluded man had proposed to spend one half the money it had cost on the erection of an industrial school for the young or a house of refuge for the deserving old in an office that might have been on the groundfloor of the tower of babel it was so massively constructed we were presented to our old schoolmaster who was one of a group composed of two or three of the busier sort of magistrates and some visitors they had brought he received me like a man who had formed my mind in bygone years and had always loved me tenderly on my introducing traddles mr creakle expressed in like manner but in an inferior degree that he had always been traddles’s guide philosopher and friend our venerable instructor was a great deal older and not improved in appearance his face was as fiery as ever his eyes were as small and rather deeper set the scanty wetlooking grey hair by which i remembered him was almost gone and the thick veins in his bald head were none the more agreeable to look at after some conversation among these gentlemen from which i might have supposed that there was nothing in the world to be legitimately taken into account but the supreme comfort of prisoners at any expense and nothing on the wide earth to be done outside prisondoors we began our inspection it being then just dinnertime we went first into the great kitchen where every prisoner’s dinner was in course of being set out separately to be handed to him in his cell with the regularity and precision of clockwork i said aside to traddles that i wondered whether it occurred to anybody that there was a striking contrast between these plentiful repasts of choice quality and the dinners not to say of paupers but of soldiers sailors labourers the great bulk of the honest working community of whom not one man in five hundred ever dined half so well but i learned that the ‘system’ required high living and in short to dispose of the system once for all i found that on that head and on all others ‘the system’ put an end to all doubts and disposed of all anomalies nobody appeared to have the least idea that there was any other system but the system to be considered as we were going through some of the magnificent passages i inquired of mr creakle and his friends what were supposed to be the main advantages of this allgoverning and universally overriding system i found them to be the perfect isolation of prisonersso that no one man in confinement there knew anything about another and the reduction of prisoners to a wholesome state of mind leading to sincere contrition and repentance now it struck me when we began to visit individuals in their cells and to traverse the passages in which those cells were and to have the manner of the going to chapel and so forth explained to us that there was a strong probability of the prisoners knowing a good deal about each other and of their carrying on a pretty complete system of intercourse this at the time i write has been proved i believe to be the case but as it would have been flat blasphemy against the system to have hinted such a doubt then i looked out for the penitence as diligently as i could and here again i had great misgivings i found as prevalent a fashion in the form of the penitence as i had left outside in the forms of the coats and waistcoats in the windows of the tailors’ shops i found a vast amount of profession varying very little in character varying very little which i thought exceedingly suspicious even in words i found a great many foxes disparaging whole vineyards of inaccessible grapes but i found very few foxes whom i would have trusted within reach of a bunch above all i found that the most professing men were the greatest objects of interest and that their conceit their vanity their want of excitement and their love of deception which many of them possessed to an almost incredible extent as their histories showed all prompted to these professions and were all gratified by them however i heard so repeatedly in the course of our goings to and fro of a certain number twenty seven who was the favourite and who really appeared to be a model prisoner that i resolved to suspend my judgement until i should see twenty seven twenty eight i understood was also a bright particular star but it was his misfortune to have his glory a little dimmed by the extraordinary lustre of twenty seven i heard so much of twenty seven of his pious admonitions to everybody around him and of the beautiful letters he constantly wrote to his mother whom he seemed to consider in a very bad way that i became quite impatient to see him i had to restrain my impatience for some time on account of twenty seven being reserved for a concluding effect but at last we came to the door of his cell and mr creakle looking through a little hole in it reported to us in a state of the greatest admiration that he was reading a hymn book there was such a rush of heads immediately to see number twenty seven reading his hymn book that the little hole was blocked up six or seven heads deep to remedy this inconvenience and give us an opportunity of conversing with twenty seven in all his purity mr creakle directed the door of the cell to be unlocked and twenty seven to be invited out into the passage this was done and whom should traddles and i then behold to our amazement in this converted number twenty seven but uriah heep he knew us directly and said as he came outwith the old writhe ‘how do you do mr copperfield how do you do mr traddles’ this recognition caused a general admiration in the party i rather thought that everyone was struck by his not being proud and taking notice of us ‘well twenty seven’ said mr creakle mournfully admiring him ‘how do you find yourself today’ ‘i am very umble sir’ replied uriah heep ‘you are always so twenty seven’ said mr creakle here another gentleman asked with extreme anxiety ‘are you quite comfortable’ ‘yes i thank you sir’ said uriah heep looking in that direction ‘far more comfortable here than ever i was outside i see my follies now sir that is what makes me comfortable’ several gentlemen were much affected and a third questioner forcing himself to the front inquired with extreme feeling ‘how do you find the beef’ ‘thank you sir’ replied uriah glancing in the new direction of this voice ‘it was tougher yesterday than i could wish but it is my duty to bear i have committed follies gentlemen’ said uriah looking round with a meek smile ‘and i ought to bear the consequences without repining’ a murmur partly of gratification at twenty seven’s celestial state of mind and partly of indignation against the contractor who had given him any because of complaint a note of which was immediately made by mr creakle having subsided twenty seven stood in the midst of us as if he felt himself the principal object of merit in a highly meritorious museum that we the neophytes might have an excess of light shining upon us all at once orders were given to let out twenty eight i had been so much astonished already that i only felt a kind of resigned wonder when mr littimer walked forth reading a good book ‘twenty eight’ said a gentleman in spectacles who had not yet spoken ‘you complained last week my good fellow of the cocoa how has it been since’ ‘i thank you sir’ said mr littimer ‘it has been better made if i might take the liberty of saying so sir i do not think the milk which is boiled with it is quite genuine but i am aware sir that there is a great adulteration of milk in london and that the article in a pure state is difficult to be obtained’ it appeared to me that the gentleman in spectacles backed his twenty eight against mr creakle’s twenty seven for each of them took his own man in hand ‘what is your state of mind twenty eight’ said the questioner in spectacles ‘i thank you sir’ returned mr littimer ‘i see my follies now sir i am a good deal troubled when i think of the sins of my former companions sir but i trust they may find forgiveness’ ‘you are quite happy yourself’ said the questioner nodding encouragement ‘i am much obliged to you sir’ returned mr littimer ‘perfectly so’ ‘is there anything at all on your mind now’ said the questioner ‘if so mention it twenty eight’ ‘sir’ said mr littimer without looking up ‘if my eyes have not deceived me there is a gentleman present who was acquainted with me in my former life it may be profitable to that gentleman to know sir that i attribute my past follies entirely to having lived a thoughtless life in the service of young men and to having allowed myself to be led by them into weaknesses which i had not the strength to resist i hope that gentleman will take warning sir and will not be offended at my freedom it is for his good i am conscious of my own past follies i hope he may repent of all the wickedness and sin to which he has been a party’ i observed that several gentlemen were shading their eyes each with one hand as if they had just come into church ‘this does you credit twenty eight’ returned the questioner ‘i should have expected it of you is there anything else’ ‘sir’ returned mr littimer slightly lifting up his eyebrows but not his eyes ‘there was a young woman who fell into dissolute courses that i endeavoured to save sir but could not rescue i beg that gentleman if he has it in his power to inform that young woman from me that i forgive her her bad conduct towards myself and that i call her to repentanceif he will be so good’ ‘i have no doubt twenty eight’ returned the questioner ‘that the gentleman you refer to feels very stronglyas we all mustwhat you have so properly said we will not detain you’ ‘i thank you sir’ said mr littimer ‘gentlemen i wish you a good day and hoping you and your families will also see your wickedness and amend’ with this number twenty eight retired after a glance between him and uriah as if they were not altogether unknown to each other through some medium of communication and a murmur went round the group as his door shut upon him that he was a most respectable man and a beautiful case ‘now twenty seven’ said mr creakle entering on a clear stage with his man ‘is there anything that anyone can do for you if so mention it’ ‘i would umbly ask sir’ returned uriah with a jerk of his malevolent head ‘for leave to write again to mother’ ‘it shall certainly be granted’ said mr creakle ‘thank you sir i am anxious about mother i am afraid she are not safe’ somebody incautiously asked what from but there was a scandalized whisper of ‘hush’ ‘immortally safe sir’ returned uriah writhing in the direction of the voice ‘i should wish mother to be got into my state i never should have been got into my present state if i had not come here i wish mother had come here it would be better for everybody if they got took up and was brought here’ this sentiment gave unbounded satisfactiongreater satisfaction i think than anything that had passed yet ‘before i come here’ said uriah stealing a look at us as if he would have blighted the outer world to which we belonged if he could ‘i was given to follies but now i am sensible of my follies there is a deal of sin outside there is a deal of sin in mother there is nothing but sin everywhereexcept here’ ‘you are quite changed’ said mr creakle ‘oh dear yes sir’ cried this hopeful penitent ‘you would not relapse if you were going out’ asked somebody else ‘oh dear no sir’ ‘well’ said mr creakle ‘this is very gratifying you have addressed mr copperfield twenty seven do you wish to say anything further to him’ ‘you knew me a long time before i came here and was changed mr copperfield’ said uriah looking at me and a more villainous look i never saw even on his visage ‘you knew me when in spite of my follies i was umble among them that was proud and meek among them that was violentyou was violent to me yourself mr copperfield once you struck me a blow in the face you know’ general commiseration several indignant glances directed at me ‘but i forgive you mr copperfield’ said uriah making his forgiving nature the subject of a most impious and awful parallel which i shall not record ‘i forgive everybody it would ill become me to bear malice i freely forgive you and i hope you will curb your passions in future i hope mr w will repent and miss w and all of that sinful lot you have been visited with affliction and i hope it may do you good but you would better have come here mr w had better have come here and miss w too the best wish i could give you mr copperfield and give all of you gentlemen is that you could be took up and brought here when i think of my past follies and my present state i am sure it would be best for you i pity all who are not brought here’ he sneaked back into his cell amidst a little chorus of approbation and both traddles and i experienced a great relief when he was locked in it was a characteristic feature in this repentance that i was fain to ask what these two men had done to be there at all that appeared to be the last thing about which they had anything to say i addressed myself to one of the two warders who i suspected from certain latent indications in their faces knew pretty well what all this stir was worth ‘do you know’ said i as we walked along the passage ‘what felony was number twenty seven’s last “folly”’ the answer was that it was a bank case ‘a fraud on the bank of england’ i asked ‘yes sir fraud forgery and conspiracy he and some others he set the others on it was a deep plot for a large sum sentence transportation for life twenty seven was the knowingest bird of the lot and had very nearly kept himself safe but not quite the bank was just able to put salt upon his tailand only just’ ‘do you know twenty eight’s offence’ ‘twenty eight’ returned my informant speaking throughout in a low tone and looking over his shoulder as we walked along the passage to guard himself from being overheard in such an unlawful reference to these immaculates by creakle and the rest ‘twenty eight also transportation got a place and robbed a young master of a matter of two hundred and fifty pounds in money and valuables the night before they were going abroad i particularly recollect his case from his being took by a dwarf’ ‘a what’ ‘a little woman i have forgot her name’ ‘not mowcher’ ‘that is it he had eluded pursuit and was going to america in a flaxen wig and whiskers and such a complete disguise as never you see in all your born days when the little woman being in southampton met him walking along the streetpicked him out with her sharp eye in a momentran betwixt his legs to upset himand held on to him like grim death’ ‘excellent miss mowcher’ cried i ‘you would have said so if you had seen her standing on a chair in the witnessbox at the trial as i did’ said my friend ‘he cut her face right open and pounded her in the most brutal manner when she took him but she never loosed her hold till he was locked up she held so tight to him in fact that the officers were obliged to take ‘them both together she gave her evidence in the gamest way and was highly complimented by the bench and cheered right home to her lodgings she said in court that she would have took him singlehanded on account of what she knew concerning him if he had been samson and it is my belief she would’ it was mine too and i highly respected miss mowcher for it we had now seen all there was to see it would have been in vain to represent to such a man as the worshipful mr creakle that twenty seven and twenty eight were perfectly consistent and unchanged that exactly what they were then they had always been that the hypocritical knaves were just the subjects to make that sort of profession in such a place that they knew its marketvalue at least as well as we did in the immediate service it would do them when they were expatriated in a word that it was a rotten hollow painfully suggestive piece of business altogether we left them to their system and themselves and went home wondering ‘perhaps it is a good thing traddles’ said i ‘to have an unsound hobby ridden hard for it is the sooner ridden to death’ ‘i hope so’ replied traddles
