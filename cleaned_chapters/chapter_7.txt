my ‘first half’ at salem house school began in earnest next day a profound impression was made upon me i remember by the roar of voices in the schoolroom suddenly becoming hushed as death when mr creakle entered after breakfast and stood in the doorway looking round upon us like a giant in a storybook surveying his captives tungay stood at mr creakle’s elbow he had no occasion i thought to cry out ‘silence’ so ferociously for the boys were all struck speechless and motionless mr creakle was seen to speak and tungay was heard to this effect ‘now boys this is a new half take care what you are about in this new half come fresh up to the lessons i advise you for i come fresh up to the punishment i will not flinch it will be of no use your rubbing yourselves you will not rub the marks out that i shall give you now get to work every boy’ when this dreadful exordium was over and tungay had stumped out again mr creakle came to where i sat and told me that if i were famous for biting he was famous for biting too he then showed me the cane and asked me what i thought of that for a tooth was it a sharp tooth hey was it a double tooth hey had it a deep prong hey did it bite hey did it bite at every question he gave me a fleshy cut with it that made me writhe so i was very soon made free of salem house as steerforth said and was very soon in tears also not that i mean to say these were special marks of distinction which only i received on the contrary a large majority of the boys especially the smaller ones were visited with similar instances of notice as mr creakle made the round of the schoolroom half the establishment was writhing and crying before the day’s work began and how much of it had writhed and cried before the day’s work was over i am really afraid to recollect lest i should seem to exaggerate i should think there never can have been a man who enjoyed his profession more than mr creakle did he had a delight in cutting at the boys which was like the satisfaction of a craving appetite i am confident that he could not resist a chubby boy especially that there was a fascination in such a subject which made him restless in his mind until he had scored and marked him for the day i was chubby myself and ought to know i am sure when i think of the fellow now my blood rises against him with the disinterested indignation i should feel if i could have known all about him without having ever been in his power but it rises hotly because i know him to have been an incapable brute who had no more right to be possessed of the great trust he held than to be lord high admiral or commanderinchiefin either of which capacities it is probable that he would have done infinitely less mischief miserable little propitiators of a remorseless idol how abject we were to him what a launch in life i think it now on looking back to be so mean and servile to a man of such parts and pretensions here i sit at the desk again watching his eyehumbly watching his eye as he rules a cipheringbook for another victim whose hands have just been flattened by that identical ruler and who is trying to wipe the sting out with a pockethandkerchief i have plenty to do i do not watch his eye in idleness but because i am morbidly attracted to it in a dread desire to know what he will do next and whether it will be my turn to suffer or somebody else’s a lane of small boys beyond me with the same interest in his eye watch it too i think he knows it though he pretends he do not he makes dreadful mouths as he rules the cipheringbook and now he throws his eye sideways down our lane and we all droop over our books and tremble a moment afterwards we are again eyeing him an unhappy culprit found guilty of imperfect exercise approaches at his command the culprit falters excuses and professes a determination to do better tomorrow mr creakle cuts a joke before he beats him and we laugh at itmiserable little dogs we laugh with our visages as white as ashes and our hearts sinking into our boots here i sit at the desk again on a drowsy summer afternoon a buzz and hum go up around me as if the boys were so many bluebottles a cloggy sensation of the lukewarm fat of meat is upon me we dined an hour or two ago and my head is as heavy as so much lead i would give the world to go to sleep i sit with my eye on mr creakle blinking at him like a young owl when sleep overpowers me for a minute he still looms through my slumber ruling those cipheringbooks until he softly comes behind me and wakes me to plainer perception of him with a red ridge across my back here i am in the playground with my eye still fascinated by him though i cannot see him the window at a little distance from which i know he is having his dinner stands for him and i eye that instead if he shows his face near it mine assumes an imploring and submissive expression if he looks out through the glass the boldest boy steerforth excepted stops in the middle of a shout or yell and becomes contemplative one day traddles the most unfortunate boy in the world breaks that window accidentally with a ball i shudder at this moment with the tremendous sensation of seeing it done and feeling that the ball has bounded on to mr creakle’s sacred head poor traddles in a tight skyblue suit that made his arms and legs like german sausages or rolypoly puddings he was the merriest and most miserable of all the boys he was always being canedi think he was caned every day that halfyear except one holiday monday when he was only ruler’d on both handsand was always going to write to his uncle about it and never did after laying his head on the desk for a little while he would cheer up somehow begin to laugh again and draw skeletons all over his slate before his eyes were dry i used at first to wonder what comfort traddles found in drawing skeletons and for some time looked upon him as a sort of hermit who reminded himself by those symbols of mortality that caning could not last for ever but i believe he only did it because they were easy and did not want any features he was very honourable traddles was and held it as a solemn duty in the boys to stand by one another he suffered for this on several occasions and particularly once when steerforth laughed in church and the beadle thought it was traddles and took him out i see him now going away in custody despised by the congregation he never said who was the real offender though he smarted for it next day and was imprisoned so many hours that he came forth with a whole churchyardfull of skeletons swarming all over his latin dictionary but he had his reward steerforth said there was nothing of the sneak in traddles and we all felt that to be the highest praise for my part i could have gone through a good deal though i was much less brave than traddles and nothing like so old to have won such a recompense to see steerforth walk to church before us arminarm with miss creakle was one of the great sights of my life i did not think miss creakle equal to little them’ly in point of beauty and i did not love her i did not dare but i thought her a young lady of extraordinary attractions and in point of gentility not to be surpassed when steerforth in white trousers carried her parasol for her i felt proud to know him and believed that she could not choose but adore him with all her heart mr sharp and mr mell were both notable personages in my eyes but steerforth was to them what the sun was to two stars steerforth continued his protection of me and proved a very useful friend since nobody dared to annoy one whom he honoured with his countenance he could notor at all events he did notdefend me from mr creakle who was very severe with me but whenever i had been treated worse than usual he always told me that i wanted a little of his pluck and that he would not have stood it himself which i felt he intended for encouragement and considered to be very kind of him there was one advantage and only one that i know of in mr creakle’s severity he found my placard in his way when he came up or down behind the form on which i sat and wanted to make a cut at me in passing for this reason it was soon taken off and i saw it no more an accidental circumstance cemented the intimacy between steerforth and me in a manner that inspired me with great pride and satisfaction though it sometimes led to inconvenience it happened on one occasion when he was doing me the honour of talking to me in the playground that i hazarded the observation that something or somebodyi forget what nowwas like something or somebody in peregrine pickle he said nothing at the time but when i was going to bed at night asked me if i had got that book i told him no and explained how it was that i had read it and all those other books of which i have made mention ‘and do you recollect them’ steerforth said ‘oh yes’ i replied i had a good memory and i believed i recollected them very well ‘then i tell you what young copperfield’ said steerforth ‘you shall tell ‘them to me i cannot get to sleep very early at night and i generally wake rather early in the morning we will go over ‘them one after another we will make some regular arabian nights of it’ i felt extremely flattered by this arrangement and we commenced carrying it into execution that very evening what ravages i committed on my favourite authors in the course of my interpretation of them i am not in a condition to say and should be very unwilling to know but i had a profound faith in them and i had to the best of my belief a simple earnest manner of narrating what i did narrate and these qualities went a long way the drawback was that i was often sleepy at night or out of spirits and indisposed to resume the story and then it was rather hard work and it must be done for to disappoint or to displease steerforth was of course out of the question in the morning too when i felt weary and should have enjoyed another hour’s repose very much it was a tiresome thing to be roused like the sultana scheherazade and forced into a long story before the gettingup bell rang but steerforth was resolute and as he explained to me in return my sums and exercises and anything in my tasks that was too hard for me i was no loser by the transaction let me do myself justice however i was moved by no interested or selfish motive nor was i moved by fear of him i admired and loved him and his approval was return enough it was so precious to me that i look back on these trifles now with an aching heart steerforth was considerate too and showed his consideration in one particular instance in an unflinching manner that was a little tantalizing i suspect to poor traddles and the rest peggotty’s promised letterwhat a comfortable letter it wasarrived before ‘the half’ was many weeks old and with it a cake in a perfect nest of oranges and two bottles of cowslip wine this treasure as in duty bound i laid at the feet of steerforth and begged him to dispense ‘now i will tell you what young copperfield’ said he ‘the wine shall be kept to wet your whistle when you are storytelling’ i blushed at the idea and begged him in my modesty not to think of it but he said he had observed i was sometimes hoarsea little roopy was his exact expressionand it should be every drop devoted to the purpose he had mentioned accordingly it was locked up in his box and drawn off by himself in a phial and administered to me through a piece of quill in the cork when i was supposed to be in want of a restorative sometimes to make it a more sovereign specific he was so kind as to squeeze orange juice into it or to stir it up with ginger or dissolve a peppermint drop in it and although i cannot assert that the flavour was improved by these experiments or that it was exactly the compound one would have chosen for a stomachic the last thing at night and the first thing in the morning i drank it gratefully and was very sensible of his attention we seem to me to have been months over peregrine and months more over the other stories the institution never flagged for want of a story i am certain and the wine lasted out almost as well as the matter poor traddlesi never think of that boy but with a strange disposition to laugh and with tears in my eyeswas a sort of chorus in general and affected to be convulsed with mirth at the comic parts and to be overcome with fear when there was any passage of an alarming character in the narrative this rather put me out very often it was a great jest of his i recollect to pretend that he could not keep his teeth from chattering whenever mention was made of an alguazill in connexion with the adventures of gil blas and i remember that when gil blas met the captain of the robbers in madrid this unlucky joker counterfeited such an ague of terror that he was overheard by mr creakle who was prowling about the passage and handsomely flogged for disorderly conduct in the bedroom whatever i had within me that was romantic and dreamy was encouraged by so much storytelling in the dark and in that respect the pursuit may not have been very profitable to me but the being cherished as a kind of plaything in my room and the consciousness that this accomplishment of mine was bruited about among the boys and attracted a good deal of notice to me though i was the youngest there stimulated me to exertion in a school carried on by sheer cruelty whether it is presided over by a dunce or not there is not likely to be much learnt i believe our boys were generally as ignorant a set as any schoolboys in existence they were too much troubled and knocked about to learn they could no more do that to advantage than any one can do anything to advantage in a life of constant misfortune torment and worry but my little vanity and steerforth’s help urged me on somehow and without saving me from much if anything in the way of punishment made me for the time i was there an exception to the general body insomuch that i did steadily pick up some crumbs of knowledge in this i was much assisted by mr mell who had a liking for me that i am grateful to remember it always gave me pain to observe that steerforth treated him with systematic disparagement and seldom lost an occasion of wounding his feelings or inducing others to do so this troubled me the more for a long time because i had soon told steerforth from whom i could no more keep such a secret than i could keep a cake or any other tangible possession about the two old women mr mell had taken me to see and i was always afraid that steerforth would let it out and twit him with it we little thought any one of us i dare say when i ate my breakfast that first morning and went to sleep under the shadow of the peacock’s feathers to the sound of the flute what consequences would come of the introduction into those almshouses of my insignificant person but the visit had its unforeseen consequences and of a serious sort too in their way one day when mr creakle kept the house from indisposition which naturally diffused a lively joy through the school there was a good deal of noise in the course of the morning’s work the great relief and satisfaction experienced by the boys made them difficult to manage and though the dreaded tungay brought his wooden leg in twice or thrice and took notes of the principal offenders’ names no great impression was made by it as they were pretty sure of getting into trouble tomorrow do what they would and thought it wise no doubt to enjoy themselves today it was properly a halfholiday being saturday but as the noise in the playground would have disturbed mr creakle and the weather was not favourable for going out walking we were ordered into school in the afternoon and set some lighter tasks than usual which were made for the occasion it was the day of the week on which mr sharp went out to get his wig curled so mr mell who always did the drudgery whatever it was kept school by himself if i could associate the idea of a bull or a bear with anyone so mild as mr mell i should think of him in connexion with that afternoon when the uproar was at its height as of one of those animals baited by a thousand dogs i recall him bending his aching head supported on his bony hand over the book on his desk and wretchedly endeavouring to get on with his tiresome work amidst an uproar that might have made the speaker of the house of commons giddy boys started in and out of their places playing at puss in the corner with other boys there were laughing boys singing boys talking boys dancing boys howling boys boys shuffled with their feet boys whirled about him grinning making faces mimicking him behind his back and before his eyes mimicking his poverty his boots his coat his mother everything belonging to him that they should have had consideration for ‘silence’ cried mr mell suddenly rising up and striking his desk with the book ‘what does this mean it is impossible to bear it it is maddening how can you do it to me boys’ it was my book that he struck his desk with and as i stood beside him following his eye as it glanced round the room i saw the boys all stop some suddenly surprised some half afraid and some sorry perhaps steerforth’s place was at the bottom of the school at the opposite end of the long room he was lounging with his back against the wall and his hands in his pockets and looked at mr mell with his mouth shut up as if he were whistling when mr mell looked at him ‘silence mr steerforth’ said mr mell ‘silence yourself’ said steerforth turning red ‘whom are you talking to’ ‘sit down’ said mr mell ‘sit down yourself’ said steerforth ‘and mind your business’ there was a titter and some applause but mr mell was so white that silence immediately succeeded and one boy who had darted out behind him to imitate his mother again changed his mind and pretended to want a pen mended ‘if you think steerforth’ said mr mell ‘that i am not acquainted with the power you can establish over any mind here’he laid his hand without considering what he did as i supposed upon my head‘or that i have not observed you within a few minutes urging your juniors on to every sort of outrage against me you are mistaken’ ‘i do not give myself the trouble of thinking at all about you’ said steerforth coolly ‘so i am not mistaken as it happens’ ‘and when you make use of your position of favouritism here sir’ pursued mr mell with his lip trembling very much ‘to insult a gentleman’ ‘a whatwhere is he’ said steerforth here somebody cried out ‘shame j steerforth too bad’ it was traddles whom mr mell instantly discomfited by bidding him hold his tongue ‘to insult one who is not fortunate in life sir and who never gave you the least offence and the many reasons for not insulting whom you are old enough and wise enough to understand’ said mr mell with his lips trembling more and more ‘you commit a mean and base action you can sit down or stand up as you please sir copperfield go on’ ‘young copperfield’ said steerforth coming forward up the room ‘stop a bit i tell you what mr mell once for all when you take the liberty of calling me mean or base or anything of that sort you are an impudent beggar you are always a beggar you know but when you do that you are an impudent beggar’ i am not clear whether he was going to strike mr mell or mr mell was going to strike him or there was any such intention on either side i saw a rigidity come upon the whole school as if they had been turned into stone and found mr creakle in the midst of us with tungay at his side and mrs and miss creakle looking in at the door as if they were frightened mr mell with his elbows on his desk and his face in his hands sat for some moments quite still ‘mr mell’ said mr creakle shaking him by the arm and his whisper was so audible now that tungay felt it unnecessary to repeat his words ‘you have not forgotten yourself i hope’ ‘no sir no’ returned the master showing his face and shaking his head and rubbing his hands in great agitation ‘no sir no i have remembered myself ino mr creakle i have not forgotten myself ii have remembered myself sir iicould wish you had remembered me a little sooner mr creakle ititwould have been more kind sir more just sir it would have saved me something sir’ mr creakle looking hard at mr mell put his hand on tungay’s shoulder and got his feet upon the form close by and sat upon the desk after still looking hard at mr mell from his throne as he shook his head and rubbed his hands and remained in the same state of agitation mr creakle turned to steerforth and said ‘now sir as he do not condescend to tell me what is this’ steerforth evaded the question for a little while looking in scorn and anger on his opponent and remaining silent i could not help thinking even in that interval i remember what a noble fellow he was in appearance and how homely and plain mr mell looked opposed to him ‘what did he mean by talking about favourites then’ said steerforth at length ‘favourites’ repeated mr creakle with the veins in his forehead swelling quickly ‘who talked about favourites’ ‘he did’ said steerforth ‘and pray what did you mean by that sir’ demanded mr creakle turning angrily on his assistant ‘i meant mr creakle’ he returned in a low voice ‘as i said that no pupil had a right to avail himself of his position of favouritism to degrade me’ ‘to degrade you’ said mr creakle ‘my stars but give me leave to ask you mr what isyourname’ and here mr creakle folded his arms cane and all upon his chest and made such a knot of his brows that his little eyes were hardly visible below them ‘whether when you talk about favourites you showed proper respect to me to me sir’ said mr creakle darting his head at him suddenly and drawing it back again ‘the principal of this establishment and your employer’ ‘it was not judicious sir i am willing to admit’ said mr mell ‘i should not have done so if i had been cool’ here steerforth struck in ‘then he said i was mean and then he said i was base and then i called him a beggar if i had been cool perhaps i should not have called him a beggar but i did and i am ready to take the consequences of it’ without considering perhaps whether there were any consequences to be taken i felt quite in a glow at this gallant speech it made an impression on the boys too for there was a low stir among them though no one spoke a word ‘i am surprised steerforthalthough your candour does you honour’ said mr creakle ‘does you honour certainlyi am surprised steerforth i must say that you should attach such an epithet to any person employed and paid in salem house sir’ steerforth gave a short laugh ‘that is not an answer sir’ said mr creakle ‘to my remark i expect more than that from you steerforth’ if mr mell looked homely in my eyes before the handsome boy it would be quite impossible to say how homely mr creakle looked ‘let him deny it’ said steerforth ‘deny that he is a beggar steerforth’ cried mr creakle ‘why where does he go abegging’ ‘if he is not a beggar himself his near relation’s one’ said steerforth ‘it is all the same’ he glanced at me and mr mell’s hand gently patted me upon the shoulder i looked up with a flush upon my face and remorse in my heart but mr mell’s eyes were fixed on steerforth he continued to pat me kindly on the shoulder but he looked at him ‘since you expect me mr creakle to justify myself’ said steerforth ‘and to say what i meanwhat i have to say is that his mother lives on charity in an almshouse’ mr mell still looked at him and still patted me kindly on the shoulder and said to himself in a whisper if i heard right ‘yes i thought so’ mr creakle turned to his assistant with a severe frown and laboured politeness ‘now you hear what this gentleman says mr mell have the goodness if you please to set him right before the assembled school’ ‘he is right sir without correction’ returned mr mell in the midst of a dead silence ‘what he has said is true’ ‘be so good then as declare publicly will you’ said mr creakle putting his head on one side and rolling his eyes round the school ‘whether it ever came to my knowledge until this moment’ ‘i believe not directly’ he returned ‘why you know not’ said mr creakle ‘do not you man’ ‘i apprehend you never supposed my worldly circumstances to be very good’ replied the assistant ‘you know what my position is and always has been here’ ‘i apprehend if you come to that’ said mr creakle with his veins swelling again bigger than ever ‘that you have been in a wrong position altogether and mistook this for a charity school mr mell we will part if you please the sooner the better’ ‘there is no time’ answered mr mell rising ‘like the present’ ‘sir to you’ said mr creakle ‘i take my leave of you mr creakle and all of you’ said mr mell glancing round the room and again patting me gently on the shoulders ‘james steerforth the best wish i can leave you is that you may come to be ashamed of what you have done today at present i would prefer to see you anything rather than a friend to me or to anyone in whom i feel an interest’ once more he laid his hand upon my shoulder and then taking his flute and a few books from his desk and leaving the key in it for his successor he went out of the school with his property under his arm mr creakle then made a speech through tungay in which he thanked steerforth for asserting though perhaps too warmly the independence and respectability of salem house and which he wound up by shaking hands with steerforth while we gave three cheersi did not quite know what for but i supposed for steerforth and so joined in them ardently though i felt miserable mr creakle then caned tommy traddles for being discovered in tears instead of cheers on account of mr mell’s departure and went back to his sofa or his bed or wherever he had come from we were left to ourselves now and looked very blank i recollect on one another for myself i felt so much selfreproach and contrition for my part in what had happened that nothing would have enabled me to keep back my tears but the fear that steerforth who often looked at me i saw might think it unfriendlyor i should rather say considering our relative ages and the feeling with which i regarded him undutifulif i showed the emotion which distressed me he was very angry with traddles and said he was glad he had caught it poor traddles who had passed the stage of lying with his head upon the desk and was relieving himself as usual with a burst of skeletons said he did not care mr mell was illused ‘who has illused him you girl’ said steerforth ‘why you have’ returned traddles ‘what have i done’ said steerforth ‘what have you done’ retorted traddles ‘hurt his feelings and lost him his situation’ ‘his feelings’ repeated steerforth disdainfully ‘his feelings will soon get the better of it i will be bound his feelings are not like yours miss traddles as to his situationwhich was a precious one was not itdo you suppose i am not going to write home and take care that he gets some money polly’ we thought this intention very noble in steerforth whose mother was a widow and rich and would do almost anything it was said that he asked her we were all extremely glad to see traddles so put down and exalted steerforth to the skies especially when he told us as he condescended to do that what he had done had been done expressly for us and for our because and that he had conferred a great boon upon us by unselfishly doing it but i must say that when i was going on with a story in the dark that night mr mell’s old flute seemed more than once to sound mournfully in my ears and that when at last steerforth was tired and i lay down in my bed i fancied it playing so sorrowfully somewhere that i was quite wretched i soon forgot him in the contemplation of steerforth who in an easy amateur way and without any book he seemed to me to know everything by heart took some of his classes until a new master was found the new master came from a grammar school and before he entered on his duties dined in the parlour one day to be introduced to steerforth steerforth approved of him highly and told us he was a brick without exactly understanding what learned distinction was meant by this i respected him greatly for it and had no doubt whatever of his superior knowledge though he never took the pains with menot that i was anybodythat mr mell had taken there was only one other event in this halfyear out of the daily schoollife that made an impression upon me which still survives it survives for many reasons one afternoon when we were all harassed into a state of dire confusion and mr creakle was laying about him dreadfully tungay came in and called out in his usual strong way ‘visitors for copperfield’ a few words were interchanged between him and mr creakle as who the visitors were and what room they were to be shown into and then i who had according to custom stood up on the announcement being made and felt quite faint with astonishment was told to go by the back stairs and get a clean frill on before i repaired to the diningroom these orders i obeyed in such a flutter and hurry of my young spirits as i had never known before and when i got to the parlour door and the thought came into my head that it might be my motheri had only thought of mr or miss murdstone until theni drew back my hand from the lock and stopped to have a sob before i went in at first i saw nobody but feeling a pressure against the door i looked round it and there to my amazement were mr peggotty and ham ducking at me with their hats and squeezing one another against the wall i could not help laughing but it was much more in the pleasure of seeing them than at the appearance they made we shook hands in a very cordial way and i laughed and laughed until i pulled out my pockethandkerchief and wiped my eyes mr peggotty who never shut his mouth once i remember during the visit showed great concern when he saw me do this and nudged ham to say something ‘cheer up mas’r davy bor’’ said ham in his simpering way ‘why how you have growed’ ‘am i grown’ i said drying my eyes i was not crying at anything in particular that i know of but somehow it made me cry to see old friends ‘growed mas’r davy bor’ are not he growed’ said ham ‘are not he growed’ said mr peggotty they made me laugh again by laughing at each other and then we all three laughed until i was in danger of crying again ‘do you know how mama is mr peggotty’ i said ‘and how my dear dear old peggotty is’ ‘oncommon’ said mr peggotty ‘and little them’ly and mrs gummidge’ ‘oncommon’ said mr peggotty there was a silence mr peggotty to relieve it took two prodigious lobsters and an enormous crab and a large canvas bag of shrimps out of his pockets and piled them up in ham’s arms ‘you see’ said mr peggotty ‘knowing as you was partial to a little relish with your wittles when you was along with us we took the liberty the old mawther biled ‘them she did mrs gummidge biled ‘them yes’ said mr peggotty slowly who i thought appeared to stick to the subject on account of having no other subject ready ‘mrs gummidge i do assure you she biled ‘them’ i expressed my thanks and mr peggotty after looking at ham who stood smiling sheepishly over the shellfish without making any attempt to help him said ‘we come you see the wind and tide making in our favour in one of our yarmouth lugs to gravesen’ my sister she wrote to me the name of this here place and wrote to me as if ever i chanced to come to gravesen’ i was to come over and inquire for mas’r davy and give her dooty humbly wishing him well and reporting of the fam’ly as they was oncommon toebesure little them’ly you see she will write to my sister when i go back as i see you and as you was similarly oncommon and so we make it quite a merrygorounder’ i was obliged to consider a little before i understood what mr peggotty meant by this figure expressive of a complete circle of intelligence i then thanked him heartily and said with a consciousness of reddening that i supposed little them’ly was altered too since we used to pick up shells and pebbles on the beach ‘she is getting to be a woman that is wot she is getting to be’ said mr peggotty ‘ask him’ he meant ham who beamed with delight and assent over the bag of shrimps ‘her pretty face’ said mr peggotty with his own shining like a light ‘her learning’ said ham ‘her writing’ said mr peggotty ‘why it is as black as jet and so large it is you might see it anywheres’ it was perfectly delightful to behold with what enthusiasm mr peggotty became inspired when he thought of his little favourite he stands before me again his bluff hairy face irradiating with a joyful love and pride for which i can find no description his honest eyes fire up and sparkle as if their depths were stirred by something bright his broad chest heaves with pleasure his strong loose hands clench themselves in his earnestness and he emphasizes what he says with a right arm that shows in my pigmy view like a sledgehammer ham was quite as earnest as he i dare say they would have said much more about her if they had not been abashed by the unexpected coming in of steerforth who seeing me in a corner speaking with two strangers stopped in a song he was singing and said ‘i did not know you were here young copperfield’ for it was not the usual visiting room and crossed by us on his way out i am not sure whether it was in the pride of having such a friend as steerforth or in the desire to explain to him how i came to have such a friend as mr peggotty that i called to him as he was going away but i said modestlygood heaven how it all comes back to me this long time afterwards ‘do not go steerforth if you please these are two yarmouth boatmenvery kind good peoplewho are relations of my nurse and have come from gravesend to see me’ ‘aye aye’ said steerforth returning ‘i am glad to see them how are you both’ there was an ease in his mannera gay and light manner it was but not swaggeringwhich i still believe to have borne a kind of enchantment with it i still believe him in virtue of this carriage his animal spirits his delightful voice his handsome face and figure and for aught i know of some inborn power of attraction besides which i think a few people possess to have carried a spell with him to which it was a natural weakness to yield and which not many persons could withstand i could not but see how pleased they were with him and how they seemed to open their hearts to him in a moment ‘you must let them know at home if you please mr peggotty’ i said ‘when that letter is sent that mr steerforth is very kind to me and that i do not know what i should ever do here without him’ ‘nonsense’ said steerforth laughing ‘you must not tell them anything of the sort’ ‘and if mr steerforth ever comes into norfolk or suffolk mr peggotty’ i said ‘while i am there you may depend upon it i shall bring him to yarmouth if he will let me to see your house you never saw such a good house steerforth it is made out of a boat’ ‘made out of a boat is it’ said steerforth ‘it is the right sort of a house for such a thoroughbuilt boatman’ ‘so ‘it is sir so ‘it is sir’ said ham grinning ‘you are right young gen’l’m’n mas’r davy bor’ gen’l’m’n’s right a thoroughbuilt boatman hor hor that is what he is too’ mr peggotty was no less pleased than his nephew though his modesty forbade him to claim a personal compliment so vociferously ‘well sir’ he said bowing and chuckling and tucking in the ends of his neckerchief at his breast ‘i thankee sir i thankee i do my endeavours in my line of life sir’ ‘the best of men can do no more mr peggotty’ said steerforth he had got his name already ‘i will pound it it is wot you do yourself sir’ said mr peggotty shaking his head ‘and wot you do wellright well i thankee sir i am obleeged to you sir for your welcoming manner of me i am rough sir but i am readyleast ways i hope i am ready you unnerstand my house are not much for to see sir but it is hearty at your service if ever you should come along with mas’r davy to see it i am a reg’lar dodman i am’ said mr peggotty by which he meant snail and this was in allusion to his being slow to go for he had attempted to go after every sentence and had somehow or other come back again ‘but i wish you both well and i wish you happy’ ham echoed this sentiment and we parted with them in the heartiest manner i was almost tempted that evening to tell steerforth about pretty little them’ly but i was too timid of mentioning her name and too much afraid of his laughing at me i remember that i thought a good deal and in an uneasy sort of way about mr peggotty having said that she was getting on to be a woman but i decided that was nonsense we transported the shellfish or the ‘relish’ as mr peggotty had modestly called it up into our room unobserved and made a great supper that evening but traddles could not get happily out of it he was too unfortunate even to come through a supper like anybody else he was taken ill in the nightquite prostrate he wasin consequence of crab and after being drugged with black draughts and blue pills to an extent which demple whose father was a doctor said was enough to undermine a horse’s constitution received a caning and six chapters of greek testament for refusing to confess the rest of the halfyear is a jumble in my recollection of the daily strife and struggle of our lives of the waning summer and the changing season of the frosty mornings when we were rung out of bed and the cold cold smell of the dark nights when we were rung into bed again of the evening schoolroom dimly lighted and indifferently warmed and the morning schoolroom which was nothing but a great shiveringmachine of the alternation of boiled beef with roast beef and boiled mutton with roast mutton of clods of breadandbutter dog’seared lessonbooks cracked slates tearblotted copybooks canings rulerings haircuttings rainy sundays suetpuddings and a dirty atmosphere of ink surrounding all i well remember though how the distant idea of the holidays after seeming for an immense time to be a stationary speck began to come towards us and to grow and grow how from counting months we came to weeks and then to days and how i then began to be afraid that i should not be sent for and when i learnt from steerforth that i had been sent for and was certainly to go home had dim forebodings that i might break my leg first how the breakingup day changed its place fast at last from the week after next to next week this week the day after tomorrow tomorrow today tonightwhen i was inside the yarmouth mail and going home i had many a broken sleep inside the yarmouth mail and many an incoherent dream of all these things but when i awoke at intervals the ground outside the window was not the playground of salem house and the sound in my ears was not the sound of mr creakle giving it to traddles but the sound of the coachman touching up the horses
