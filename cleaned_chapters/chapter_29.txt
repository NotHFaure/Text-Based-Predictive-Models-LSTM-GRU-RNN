i visit steerforth at his home again i mentioned to mr spenlow in the morning that i wanted leave of absence for a short time and as i was not in the receipt of any salary and consequently was not obnoxious to the implacable jorkins there was no difficulty about it i took that opportunity with my voice sticking in my throat and my sight failing as i uttered the words to express my hope that miss spenlow was quite well to which mr spenlow replied with no more emotion than if he had been speaking of an ordinary human being that he was much obliged to me and she was very well we articled clerks as germs of the patrician order of proctors were treated with so much consideration that i was almost my own master at all times as i did not care however to get to highgate before one or two of the clock in the day and as we had another little excommunication case in court that morning which was called the office of the judge promoted by tipkins against bullock for his soul’s correction i passed an hour or two in attendance on it with mr spenlow very agreeably it arose out of a scuffle between two churchwardens one of whom was alleged to have pushed the other against a pump the handle of which pump projecting into a schoolhouse which schoolhouse was under a gable of the churchroof made the push an ecclesiastical offence it was an amusing case and sent me up to highgate on the box of the stagecoach thinking about the commons and what mr spenlow had said about touching the commons and bringing down the country mrs steerforth was pleased to see me and so was rosa dartle i was agreeably surprised to find that littimer was not there and that we were attended by a modest little parlourmaid with blue ribbons in her cap whose eye it was much more pleasant and much less disconcerting to catch by accident than the eye of that respectable man but what i particularly observed before i had been halfanhour in the house was the close and attentive watch miss dartle kept upon me and the lurking manner in which she seemed to compare my face with steerforth’s and steerforth’s with mine and to lie in wait for something to come out between the two so surely as i looked towards her did i see that eager visage with its gaunt black eyes and searching brow intent on mine or passing suddenly from mine to steerforth’s or comprehending both of us at once in this lynxlike scrutiny she was so far from faltering when she saw i observed it that at such a time she only fixed her piercing look upon me with a more intent expression still blameless as i was and knew that i was in reference to any wrong she could possibly suspect me of i shrunk before her strange eyes quite unable to endure their hungry lustre all day she seemed to pervade the whole house if i talked to steerforth in his room i heard her dress rustle in the little gallery outside when he and i engaged in some of our old exercises on the lawn behind the house i saw her face pass from window to window like a wandering light until it fixed itself in one and watched us when we all four went out walking in the afternoon she closed her thin hand on my arm like a spring to keep me back while steerforth and his mother went on out of hearing and then spoke to me ‘you have been a long time’ she said ‘without coming here is your profession really so engaging and interesting as to absorb your whole attention i ask because i always want to be informed when i am ignorant is it really though’ i replied that i liked it well enough but that i certainly could not claim so much for it ‘oh i am glad to know that because i always like to be put right when i am wrong’ said rosa dartle ‘you mean it is a little dry perhaps’ ‘well’ i replied ‘perhaps it was a little dry’ ‘oh and that is a reason why you want relief and changeexcitement and all that’ said she ‘ah very true but is not it a littleehfor him i do not mean you’ a quick glance of her eye towards the spot where steerforth was walking with his mother leaning on his arm showed me whom she meant but beyond that i was quite lost and i looked so i have no doubt ‘do not iti do not say that it does mind i want to knowdo not it rather engross him do not it make him perhaps a little more remiss than usual in his visits to his blindlydotingeh’ with another quick glance at them and such a glance at me as seemed to look into my innermost thoughts ‘miss dartle’ i returned ‘pray do not think’ ‘i do not’ she said ‘oh dear me do not suppose that i think anything i am not suspicious i only ask a question i do not state any opinion i want to found an opinion on what you tell me then it is not so well i am very glad to know it’ ‘it certainly is not the fact’ said i perplexed ‘that i am accountable for steerforth’s having been away from home longer than usualif he has been which i really do not know at this moment unless i understand it from you i have not seen him this long while until last night’ ‘no’ ‘indeed miss dartle no’ as she looked full at me i saw her face grow sharper and paler and the marks of the old wound lengthen out until it cut through the disfigured lip and deep into the nether lip and slanted down the face there was something positively awful to me in this and in the brightness of her eyes as she said looking fixedly at me ‘what is he doing’ i repeated the words more to myself than her being so amazed ‘what is he doing’ she said with an eagerness that seemed enough to consume her like a fire ‘in what is that man assisting him who never looks at me without an inscrutable falsehood in his eyes if you are honourable and faithful i do not ask you to betray your friend i ask you only to tell me is it anger is it hatred is it pride is it restlessness is it some wild fancy is it love what is it that is leading him’ ‘miss dartle’ i returned ‘how shall i tell you so that you will believe me that i know of nothing in steerforth different from what there was when i first came here i can think of nothing i firmly believe there is nothing i hardly understand even what you mean’ as she still stood looking fixedly at me a twitching or throbbing from which i could not dissociate the idea of pain came into that cruel mark and lifted up the corner of her lip as if with scorn or with a pity that despised its object she put her hand upon it hurriedlya hand so thin and delicate that when i had seen her hold it up before the fire to shade her face i had compared it in my thoughts to fine porcelainand saying in a quick fierce passionate way ‘i swear you to secrecy about this’ said not a word more mrs steerforth was particularly happy in her son’s society and steerforth was on this occasion particularly attentive and respectful to her it was very interesting to me to see them together not only on account of their mutual affection but because of the strong personal resemblance between them and the manner in which what was haughty or impetuous in him was softened by age and sex in her to a gracious dignity i thought more than once that it was well no serious because of division had ever come between them or two such naturesi ought rather to express it two such shades of the same naturemight have been harder to reconcile than the two extremest opposites in creation the idea did not originate in my own discernment i am bound to confess but in a speech of rosa dartle’s she said at dinner ‘oh but do tell me though somebody because i have been thinking about it all day and i want to know’ ‘you want to know what rosa’ returned mrs steerforth ‘pray pray rosa do not be mysterious’ ‘mysterious’ she cried ‘oh really do you consider me so’ ‘do i constantly entreat you’ said mrs steerforth ‘to speak plainly in your own natural manner’ ‘oh then this is not my natural manner’ she rejoined ‘now you must really bear with me because i ask for information we never know ourselves’ ‘it has become a second nature’ said mrs steerforth without any displeasure ‘but i rememberand so must you i thinkwhen your manner was different rosa when it was not so guarded and was more trustful’ ‘i am sure you are right’ she returned ‘and so it is that bad habits grow upon one really less guarded and more trustful how can i imperceptibly have changed i wonder well that is very odd i must study to regain my former self’ ‘i wish you would’ said mrs steerforth with a smile ‘oh i really will you know’ she answered ‘i will learn frankness fromlet me seefrom james’ ‘you cannot learn frankness rosa’ said mrs steerforth quicklyfor there was always some effect of sarcasm in what rosa dartle said though it was said as this was in the most unconscious manner in the world‘in a better school’ ‘that i am sure of’ she answered with uncommon fervour ‘if i am sure of anything of course you know i am sure of that’ mrs steerforth appeared to me to regret having been a little nettled for she presently said in a kind tone ‘well my dear rosa we have not heard what it is that you want to be satisfied about’ ‘that i want to be satisfied about’ she replied with provoking coldness ‘oh it was only whether people who are like each other in their moral constitutionis that the phrase’ ‘it is as good a phrase as another’ said steerforth ‘thank youwhether people who are like each other in their moral constitution are in greater danger than people not so circumstanced supposing any serious because of variance to arise between them of being divided angrily and deeply’ ‘i should say yes’ said steerforth ‘should you’ she retorted ‘dear me supposing then for instanceany unlikely thing will do for a suppositionthat you and your mother were to have a serious quarrel’ ‘my dear rosa’ interposed mrs steerforth laughing goodnaturedly ‘suggest some other supposition james and i know our duty to each other better i pray heaven’ ‘oh’ said miss dartle nodding her head thoughtfully ‘to be sure that would prevent it why of course it would exactly now i am glad i have been so foolish as to put the case for it is so very good to know that your duty to each other would prevent it thank you very much’ one other little circumstance connected with miss dartle i must not omit for i had reason to remember it thereafter when all the irremediable past was rendered plain during the whole of this day but especially from this period of it steerforth exerted himself with his utmost skill and that was with his utmost ease to charm this singular creature into a pleasant and pleased companion that he should succeed was no matter of surprise to me that she should struggle against the fascinating influence of his delightful artdelightful nature i thought it thendid not surprise me either for i knew that she was sometimes jaundiced and perverse i saw her features and her manner slowly change i saw her look at him with growing admiration i saw her try more and more faintly but always angrily as if she condemned a weakness in herself to resist the captivating power that he possessed and finally i saw her sharp glance soften and her smile become quite gentle and i ceased to be afraid of her as i had really been all day and we all sat about the fire talking and laughing together with as little reserve as if we had been children whether it was because we had sat there so long or because steerforth was resolved not to lose the advantage he had gained i do not know but we did not remain in the diningroom more than five minutes after her departure ‘she is playing her harp’ said steerforth softly at the drawingroom door ‘and nobody but my mother has heard her do that i believe these three years’ he said it with a curious smile which was gone directly and we went into the room and found her alone ‘do not get up’ said steerforth which she had already done’ my dear rosa do not be kind for once and sing us an irish song’ ‘what do you care for an irish song’ she returned ‘much’ said steerforth ‘much more than for any other here is daisy too loves music from his soul sing us an irish song rosa and let me sit and listen as i used to do’ he did not touch her or the chair from which she had risen but sat himself near the harp she stood beside it for some little while in a curious way going through the motion of playing it with her right hand but not sounding it at length she sat down and drew it to her with one sudden action and played and sang i do not know what it was in her touch or voice that made that song the most unearthly i have ever heard in my life or can imagine there was something fearful in the reality of it it was as if it had never been written or set to music but sprung out of passion within her which found imperfect utterance in the low sounds of her voice and crouched again when all was still i was dumb when she leaned beside the harp again playing it but not sounding it with her right hand a minute more and this had roused me from my trancesteerforth had left his seat and gone to her and had put his arm laughingly about her and had said ‘come rosa for the future we will love each other very much’ and she had struck him and had thrown him off with the fury of a wild cat and had burst out of the room ‘what is the matter with rosa’ said mrs steerforth coming in ‘she has been an angel mother’ returned steerforth ‘for a little while and has run into the opposite extreme since by way of compensation’ ‘you should be careful not to irritate her james her temper has been soured remember and ought not to be tried’ rosa did not come back and no other mention was made of her until i went with steerforth into his room to say good night then he laughed about her and asked me if i had ever seen such a fierce little piece of incomprehensibility i expressed as much of my astonishment as was then capable of expression and asked if he could guess what it was that she had taken so much amiss so suddenly ‘oh heaven knows’ said steerforth ‘anything you likeor nothing i told you she took everything herself included to a grindstone and sharpened it she is an edgetool and requires great care in dealing with she is always dangerous good night’ ‘good night’ said i ‘my dear steerforth i shall be gone before you wake in the morning good night’ he was unwilling to let me go and stood holding me out with a hand on each of my shoulders as he had done in my own room ‘daisy’ he said with a smile‘for though that is not the name your godfathers and godmothers gave you it is the name i like best to call you byand i wish i wish i wish you could give it to me’ ‘why so i can if i choose’ said i ‘daisy if anything should ever separate us you must think of me at my best old boy come let us make that bargain think of me at my best if circumstances should ever part us’ ‘you have no best to me steerforth’ said i ‘and no worst you are always equally loved and cherished in my heart’ so much compunction for having ever wronged him even by a shapeless thought did i feel within me that the confession of having done so was rising to my lips but for the reluctance i had to betray the confidence of agnes but for my uncertainty how to approach the subject with no risk of doing so it would have reached them before he said ‘god bless you daisy and good night’ in my doubt it did not reach them and we shook hands and we parted i was up with the dull dawn and having dressed as quietly as i could looked into his room he was fast asleep lying easily with his head upon his arm as i had often seen him lie at school the time came in its season and that was very soon when i almost wondered that nothing troubled his repose as i looked at him but he sleptlet me think of him so againas i had often seen him sleep at school and thus in this silent hour i left him never more oh god forgive you steerforth to touch that passive hand in love and friendship never never more
