little them’ly there was a servant in that house a man who i understood was usually with steerforth and had come into his service at the university who was in appearance a pattern of respectability i believe there never existed in his station a more respectablelooking man he was taciturn softfooted very quiet in his manner deferential observant always at hand when wanted and never near when not wanted but his great claim to consideration was his respectability he had not a pliant face he had rather a stiff neck rather a tight smooth head with short hair clinging to it at the sides a soft way of speaking with a peculiar habit of whispering the letter s so distinctly that he seemed to use it oftener than any other man but every peculiarity that he had he made respectable if his nose had been upsidedown he would have made that respectable he surrounded himself with an atmosphere of respectability and walked secure in it it would have been next to impossible to suspect him of anything wrong he was so thoroughly respectable nobody could have thought of putting him in a livery he was so highly respectable to have imposed any derogatory work upon him would have been to inflict a wanton insult on the feelings of a most respectable man and of this i noticedthe womenservants in the household were so intuitively conscious that they always did such work themselves and generally while he read the paper by the pantry fire such a selfcontained man i never saw but in that quality as in every other he possessed he only seemed to be the more respectable even the fact that no one knew his christian name seemed to form a part of his respectability nothing could be objected against his surname littimer by which he was known peter might have been hanged or tom transported but littimer was perfectly respectable it was occasioned i suppose by the reverend nature of respectability in the abstract but i felt particularly young in this man’s presence how old he was himself i could not guessand that again went to his credit on the same score for in the calmness of respectability he might have numbered fifty years as well as thirty littimer was in my room in the morning before i was up to bring me that reproachful shavingwater and to put out my clothes when i undrew the curtains and looked out of bed i saw him in an equable temperature of respectability unaffected by the east wind of january and not even breathing frostily standing my boots right and left in the first dancing position and blowing specks of dust off my coat as he laid it down like a baby i gave him good morning and asked him what of the clock it was he took out of his pocket the most respectable huntingwatch i ever saw and preventing the spring with his thumb from opening far looked in at the face as if he were consulting an oracular oyster shut it up again and said if i pleased it was half past eight ‘mr steerforth will be glad to hear how you have rested sir’ ‘thank you’ said i ‘very well indeed is mr steerforth quite well’ ‘thank you sir mr steerforth is tolerably well’ another of his characteristicsno use of superlatives a cool calm medium always ‘is there anything more i can have the honour of doing for you sir the warningbell will ring at nine the family take breakfast at half past nine’ ‘nothing i thank you’ ‘i thank you sir if you please’ and with that and with a little inclination of his head when he passed the bedside as an apology for correcting me he went out shutting the door as delicately as if i had just fallen into a sweet sleep on which my life depended every morning we held exactly this conversation never any more and never any less and yet invariably however far i might have been lifted out of myself overnight and advanced towards maturer years by steerforth’s companionship or mrs steerforth’s confidence or miss dartle’s conversation in the presence of this most respectable man i became as our smaller poets sing ‘a boy again’ he got horses for us and steerforth who knew everything gave me lessons in riding he provided foils for us and steerforth gave me lessons in fencinggloves and i began of the same master to improve in boxing it gave me no manner of concern that steerforth should find me a novice in these sciences but i never could bear to show my want of skill before the respectable littimer i had no reason to believe that littimer understood such arts himself he never led me to suppose anything of the kind by so much as the vibration of one of his respectable eyelashes yet whenever he was by while we were practising i felt myself the greenest and most inexperienced of mortals i am particular about this man because he made a particular effect on me at that time and because of what took place thereafter the week passed away in a most delightful manner it passed rapidly as may be supposed to one entranced as i was and yet it gave me so many occasions for knowing steerforth better and admiring him more in a thousand respects that at its close i seemed to have been with him for a much longer time a dashing way he had of treating me like a plaything was more agreeable to me than any behaviour he could have adopted it reminded me of our old acquaintance it seemed the natural sequel of it it showed me that he was unchanged it relieved me of any uneasiness i might have felt in comparing my merits with his and measuring my claims upon his friendship by any equal standard above all it was a familiar unrestrained affectionate demeanour that he used towards no one else as he had treated me at school differently from all the rest i joyfully believed that he treated me in life unlike any other friend he had i believed that i was nearer to his heart than any other friend and my own heart warmed with attachment to him he made up his mind to go with me into the country and the day arrived for our departure he had been doubtful at first whether to take littimer or not but decided to leave him at home the respectable creature satisfied with his lot whatever it was arranged our portmanteaux on the little carriage that was to take us into london as if they were intended to defy the shocks of ages and received my modestly proffered donation with perfect tranquillity we bade adieu to mrs steerforth and miss dartle with many thanks on my part and much kindness on the devoted mother’s the last thing i saw was littimer’s unruffled eye fraught as i fancied with the silent conviction that i was very young indeed what i felt in returning so auspiciously to the old familiar places i shall not endeavour to describe we went down by the mail i was so concerned i recollect even for the honour of yarmouth that when steerforth said as we drove through its dark streets to the inn that as well as he could make out it was a good queer outoftheway kind of hole i was highly pleased we went to bed on our arrival i observed a pair of dirty shoes and gaiters in connexion with my old friend the dolphin as we passed that door and breakfasted late in the morning steerforth who was in great spirits had been strolling about the beach before i was up and had made acquaintance he said with half the boatmen in the place moreover he had seen in the distance what he was sure must be the identical house of mr peggotty with smoke coming out of the chimney and had had a great mind he told me to walk in and swear he was myself grown out of knowledge ‘when do you propose to introduce me there daisy’ he said ‘i am at your disposal make your own arrangements’ ‘why i was thinking that this evening would be a good time steerforth when they are all sitting round the fire i should like you to see it when it is snug it is such a curious place’ ‘so be it’ returned steerforth ‘this evening’ ‘i shall not give them any notice that we are here you know’ said i delighted ‘we must take them by surprise’ ‘oh of course it is no fun’ said steerforth ‘unless we take them by surprise let us see the natives in their aboriginal condition’ ‘though they are that sort of people that you mentioned’ i returned ‘aha what you recollect my skirmishes with rosa do you’ he exclaimed with a quick look ‘confound the girl i am half afraid of her she is like a goblin to me but never mind her now what are you going to do you are going to see your nurse i suppose’ ‘why yes’ i said ‘i must see peggotty first of all’ ‘well’ replied steerforth looking at his watch ‘suppose i deliver you up to be cried over for a couple of hours is that long enough’ i answered laughing that i thought we might get through it in that time but that he must come also for he would find that his renown had preceded him and that he was almost as great a personage as i was ‘i will come anywhere you like’ said steerforth ‘or do anything you like tell me where to come to and in two hours i will produce myself in any state you please sentimental or comical’ i gave him minute directions for finding the residence of mr barkis carrier to blunderstone and elsewhere and on this understanding went out alone there was a sharp bracing air the ground was dry the sea was crisp and clear the sun was diffusing abundance of light if not much warmth and everything was fresh and lively i was so fresh and lively myself in the pleasure of being there that i could have stopped the people in the streets and shaken hands with them the streets looked small of course the streets that we have only seen as children always do i believe when we go back to them but i had forgotten nothing in them and found nothing changed until i came to mr omer’s shop omer and joram was now written up where omer used to be but the inscription draper tailor haberdasher funeral furnisher c remained as it was my footsteps seemed to tend so naturally to the shop door after i had read these words from over the way that i went across the road and looked in there was a pretty woman at the back of the shop dancing a little child in her arms while another little fellow clung to her apron i had no difficulty in recognizing either minnie or minnie’s children the glass door of the parlour was not open but in the workshop across the yard i could faintly hear the old tune playing as if it had never left off ‘is mr omer at home’ said i entering ‘i should like to see him for a moment if he is’ ‘oh yes sir he is at home’ said minnie ‘the weather do not suit his asthma out of doors joe call your grandfather’ the little fellow who was holding her apron gave such a lusty shout that the sound of it made him bashful and he buried his face in her skirts to her great admiration i heard a heavy puffing and blowing coming towards us and soon mr omer shorterwinded than of yore but not much olderlooking stood before me ‘servant sir’ said mr omer ‘what can i do for you sir’ ‘you can shake hands with me mr omer if you please’ said i putting out my own ‘you were very goodnatured to me once when i am afraid i did not show that i thought so’ ‘was i though’ returned the old man ‘i am glad to hear it but i do not remember when are you sure it was me’ ‘quite’ ‘i think my memory has got as short as my breath’ said mr omer looking at me and shaking his head ‘for i do not remember you’ ‘do not you remember your coming to the coach to meet me and my having breakfast here and our riding out to blunderstone together you and i and mrs joram and mr joram toowho was not her husband then’ ‘why lord bless my soul’ exclaimed mr omer after being thrown by his surprise into a fit of coughing ‘you do not say so minnie my dear you recollect dear me yes the party was a lady i think’ ‘my mother’ i rejoined ‘tobesure’ said mr omer touching my waistcoat with his forefinger ‘and there was a little child too there was two parties the little party was laid along with the other party over at blunderstone it was of course dear me and how have you been since’ very well i thanked him as i hoped he had been too ‘oh nothing to grumble at you know’ said mr omer ‘i find my breath gets short but it seldom gets longer as a man gets older i take it as it comes and make the most of it that is the best way are not it’ mr omer coughed again in consequence of laughing and was assisted out of his fit by his daughter who now stood close beside us dancing her smallest child on the counter ‘dear me’ said mr omer ‘yes to be sure two parties why in that very ride if you will believe me the day was named for my minnie to marry joram “do name it sir” says joram “yes do father” says minnie and now he is come into the business and look here the youngest’ minnie laughed and stroked her banded hair upon her temples as her father put one of his fat fingers into the hand of the child she was dancing on the counter ‘two parties of course’ said mr omer nodding his head retrospectively ‘exactly so and joram’s at work at this minute on a grey one with silver nails not this measurement’the measurement of the dancing child upon the counter‘by a good two incheswill you take something’ i thanked him but declined ‘let me see’ said mr omer ‘barkis’s the carrier’s wifepeggotty’s the boatman’s sistershe had something to do with your family she was in service there sure’ my answering in the affirmative gave him great satisfaction ‘i believe my breath will get long next my memory’s getting so much so’ said mr omer ‘well sir we have got a young relation of hers here under articles to us that has as elegant a taste in the dressmaking businessi assure you i do not believe there is a duchess in england can touch her’ ‘not little them’ly’ said i involuntarily ‘them’ly’s her name’ said mr omer ‘and she is little too but if you will believe me she has such a face of her own that half the women in this town are mad against her’ ‘nonsense father’ cried minnie ‘my dear’ said mr omer ‘i do not say it is the case with you’ winking at me ‘but i say that half the women in yarmouthah and in five mile roundare mad against that girl’ ‘then she should have kept to her own station in life father’ said minnie ‘and not have given them any hold to talk about her and then they could not have done it’ ‘could not have done it my dear’ retorted mr omer ‘could not have done it is that your knowledge of life what is there that any woman could not do that she should not doespecially on the subject of another woman’s good looks’ i really thought it was all over with mr omer after he had uttered this libellous pleasantry he coughed to that extent and his breath eluded all his attempts to recover it with that obstinacy that i fully expected to see his head go down behind the counter and his little black breeches with the rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees come quivering up in a last ineffectual struggle at length however he got better though he still panted hard and was so exhausted that he was obliged to sit on the stool of the shopdesk ‘you see’ he said wiping his head and breathing with difficulty ‘she has not taken much to any companions here she has not taken kindly to any particular acquaintances and friends not to mention sweethearts in consequence an illnatured story got about that them’ly wanted to be a lady now my opinion is that it came into circulation principally on account of her sometimes saying at the school that if she was a lady she would like to do soandso for her uncledo not you seeand buy him suchandsuch fine things’ ‘i assure you mr omer she has said so to me’ i returned eagerly ‘when we were both children’ mr omer nodded his head and rubbed his chin ‘just so then out of a very little she could dress herself you see better than most others could out of a deal and that made things unpleasant moreover she was rather what might be called waywardi will go so far as to say what i should call wayward myself’ said mr omer ‘did not know her own mind quitea little spoiledand could not at first exactly bind herself down no more than that was ever said against her minnie’ ‘no father’ said mrs joram ‘that is the worst i believe’ ‘so when she got a situation’ said mr omer ‘to keep a fractious old lady company they did not very well agree and she did not stop at last she came here apprenticed for three years nearly two of ‘them are over and she has been as good a girl as ever was worth any six minnie is she worth any six now’ ‘yes father’ replied minnie ‘never say i detracted from her’ ‘very good’ said mr omer ‘that is right and so young gentleman’ he added after a few moments’ further rubbing of his chin ‘that you may not consider me longwinded as well as shortbreathed i believe that is all about it’ as they had spoken in a subdued tone while speaking of them’ly i had no doubt that she was near on my asking now if that were not so mr omer nodded yes and nodded towards the door of the parlour my hurried inquiry if i might peep in was answered with a free permission and looking through the glass i saw her sitting at her work i saw her a most beautiful little creature with the cloudless blue eyes that had looked into my childish heart turned laughingly upon another child of minnie’s who was playing near her with enough of wilfulness in her bright face to justify what i had heard with much of the old capricious coyness lurking in it but with nothing in her pretty looks i am sure but what was meant for goodness and for happiness and what was on a good and happy course the tune across the yard that seemed as if it never had left offalas it was the tune that never does leave offwas beating softly all the while ‘would not you like to step in’ said mr omer ‘and speak to her walk in and speak to her sir make yourself at home’ i was too bashful to do so theni was afraid of confusing her and i was no less afraid of confusing myselfbut i informed myself of the hour at which she left of an evening in order that our visit might be timed accordingly and taking leave of mr omer and his pretty daughter and her little children went away to my dear old peggotty’s here she was in the tiled kitchen cooking dinner the moment i knocked at the door she opened it and asked me what i pleased to want i looked at her with a smile but she gave me no smile in return i had never ceased to write to her but it must have been seven years since we had met ‘is mr barkis at home madam’ i said feigning to speak roughly to her ‘he is at home sir’ returned peggotty ‘but he is bad abed with the rheumatics’ ‘do not he go over to blunderstone now’ i asked ‘when he is well he do’ she answered ‘do you ever go there mrs barkis’ she looked at me more attentively and i noticed a quick movement of her hands towards each other ‘because i want to ask a question about a house there that they call thewhat is itthe rookery’ said i she took a step backward and put out her hands in an undecided frightened way as if to keep me off ‘peggotty’ i cried to her she cried ‘my darling boy’ and we both burst into tears and were locked in one another’s arms what extravagances she committed what laughing and crying over me what pride she showed what joy what sorrow that she whose pride and joy i might have been could never hold me in a fond embrace i have not the heart to tell i was troubled with no misgiving that it was young in me to respond to her emotions i had never laughed and cried in all my life i dare saynot even to hermore freely than i did that morning ‘barkis will be so glad’ said peggotty wiping her eyes with her apron ‘that it will do him more good than pints of liniment may i go and tell him you are here will you come up and see him my dear’ of course i would but peggotty could not get out of the room as easily as she meant to for as often as she got to the door and looked round at me she came back again to have another laugh and another cry upon my shoulder at last to make the matter easier i went upstairs with her and having waited outside for a minute while she said a word of preparation to mr barkis presented myself before that invalid he received me with absolute enthusiasm he was too rheumatic to be shaken hands with but he begged me to shake the tassel on the top of his nightcap which i did most cordially when i sat down by the side of the bed he said that it did him a world of good to feel as if he was driving me on the blunderstone road again as he lay in bed face upward and so covered with that exception that he seemed to be nothing but a facelike a conventional cherubimhe looked the queerest object i ever beheld ‘what name was it as i wrote up in the cart sir’ said mr barkis with a slow rheumatic smile ‘ah mr barkis we had some grave talks about that matter had not we’ ‘i was willin’ a long time sir’ said mr barkis ‘a long time’ said i ‘and i do not regret it’ said mr barkis ‘do you remember what you told me once about her making all the apple parsties and doing all the cooking’ ‘yes very well’ i returned ‘it was as true’ said mr barkis ‘as turnips is it was as true’ said mr barkis nodding his nightcap which was his only means of emphasis ‘as taxes is and nothing’s truer than them’ mr barkis turned his eyes upon me as if for my assent to this result of his reflections in bed and i gave it ‘nothing’s truer than them’ repeated mr barkis ‘a man as poor as i am finds that out in his mind when he is laid up i am a very poor man sir’ ‘i am sorry to hear it mr barkis’ ‘a very poor man indeed i am’ said mr barkis here his right hand came slowly and feebly from under the bedclothes and with a purposeless uncertain grasp took hold of a stick which was loosely tied to the side of the bed after some poking about with this instrument in the course of which his face assumed a variety of distracted expressions mr barkis poked it against a box an end of which had been visible to me all the time then his face became composed ‘old clothes’ said mr barkis ‘oh’ said i ‘i wish it was money sir’ said mr barkis ‘i wish it was indeed’ said i ‘but it are not’ said mr barkis opening both his eyes as wide as he possibly could i expressed myself quite sure of that and mr barkis turning his eyes more gently to his wife said ‘she is the usefullest and best of women c p barkis all the praise that anyone can give to c p barkis she deserves and more my dear you will get a dinner today for company something good to eat and drink will you’ i should have protested against this unnecessary demonstration in my honour but that i saw peggotty on the opposite side of the bed extremely anxious i should not so i held my peace ‘i have got a trifle of money somewhere about me my dear’ said mr barkis ‘but i am a little tired if you and mr david will leave me for a short nap i will try and find it when i wake’ we left the room in compliance with this request when we got outside the door peggotty informed me that mr barkis being now ‘a little nearer’ than he used to be always resorted to this same device before producing a single coin from his store and that he endured unheardof agonies in crawling out of bed alone and taking it from that unlucky box in effect we presently heard him uttering suppressed groans of the most dismal nature as this magpie proceeding racked him in every joint but while peggotty’s eyes were full of compassion for him she said his generous impulse would do him good and it was better not to check it so he groaned on until he had got into bed again suffering i have no doubt a martyrdom and then called us in pretending to have just woke up from a refreshing sleep and to produce a guinea from under his pillow his satisfaction in which happy imposition on us and in having preserved the impenetrable secret of the box appeared to be a sufficient compensation to him for all his tortures i prepared peggotty for steerforth’s arrival and it was not long before he came i am persuaded she knew no difference between his having been a personal benefactor of hers and a kind friend to me and that she would have received him with the utmost gratitude and devotion in any case but his easy spirited good humour his genial manner his handsome looks his natural gift of adapting himself to whomsoever he pleased and making direct when he cared to do it to the main point of interest in anybody’s heart bound her to him wholly in five minutes his manner to me alone would have won her but through all these causes combined i sincerely believe she had a kind of adoration for him before he left the house that night he stayed there with me to dinnerif i were to say willingly i should not half express how readily and gaily he went into mr barkis’s room like light and air brightening and refreshing it as if he were healthy weather there was no noise no effort no consciousness in anything he did but in everything an indescribable lightness a seeming impossibility of doing anything else or doing anything better which was so graceful so natural and agreeable that it overcomes me even now in the remembrance we made merry in the little parlour where the book of martyrs unthumbed since my time was laid out upon the desk as of old and where i now turned over its terrific pictures remembering the old sensations they had awakened but not feeling them when peggotty spoke of what she called my room and of its being ready for me at night and of her hoping i would occupy it before i could so much as look at steerforth hesitating he was possessed of the whole case ‘of course’ he said ‘you will sleep here while we stay and i shall sleep at the hotel’ ‘but to bring you so far’ i returned ‘and to separate seems bad companionship steerforth’ ‘why in the name of heaven where do you naturally belong’ he said ‘what is “seems” compared to that’ it was settled at once he maintained all his delightful qualities to the last until we started forth at eight of the clock for mr peggotty’s boat indeed they were more and more brightly exhibited as the hours went on for i thought even then and i have no doubt now that the consciousness of success in his determination to please inspired him with a new delicacy of perception and made it subtle as it was more easy to him if anyone had told me then that all this was a brilliant game played for the excitement of the moment for the employment of high spirits in the thoughtless love of superiority in a mere wasteful careless course of winning what was worthless to him and next minute thrown awayi say if anyone had told me such a lie that night i wonder in what manner of receiving it my indignation would have found a vent probably only in an increase had that been possible of the romantic feelings of fidelity and friendship with which i walked beside him over the dark wintry sands towards the old boat the wind sighing around us even more mournfully than it had sighed and moaned upon the night when i first darkened mr peggotty’s door ‘this is a wild kind of place steerforth is it not’ ‘dismal enough in the dark’ he said ‘and the sea roars as if it were hungry for us is that the boat where i see a light yonder’ ‘that is the boat’ said i ‘and it is the same i saw this morning’ he returned ‘i came straight to it by instinct i suppose’ we said no more as we approached the light but made softly for the door i laid my hand upon the latch and whispering steerforth to keep close to me went in a murmur of voices had been audible on the outside and at the moment of our entrance a clapping of hands which latter noise i was surprised to see proceeded from the generally disconsolate mrs gummidge but mrs gummidge was not the only person there who was unusually excited mr peggotty his face lighted up with uncommon satisfaction and laughing with all his might held his rough arms wide open as if for little them’ly to run into them ham with a mixed expression in his face of admiration exultation and a lumbering sort of bashfulness that sat upon him very well held little them’ly by the hand as if he were presenting her to mr peggotty little them’ly herself blushing and shy but delighted with mr peggotty’s delight as her joyous eyes expressed was stopped by our entrance for she saw us first in the very act of springing from ham to nestle in mr peggotty’s embrace in the first glimpse we had of them all and at the moment of our passing from the dark cold night into the warm light room this was the way in which they were all employed mrs gummidge in the background clapping her hands like a madwoman the little picture was so instantaneously dissolved by our going in that one might have doubted whether it had ever been i was in the midst of the astonished family face to face with mr peggotty and holding out my hand to him when ham shouted ‘mas’r davy it is mas’r davy’ in a moment we were all shaking hands with one another and asking one another how we did and telling one another how glad we were to meet and all talking at once mr peggotty was so proud and overjoyed to see us that he did not know what to say or do but kept over and over again shaking hands with me and then with steerforth and then with me and then ruffling his shaggy hair all over his head and laughing with such glee and triumph that it was a treat to see him ‘why that you two gent’lmengent’lmen growedshould come to this here roof tonight of all nights in my life’ said mr peggotty ‘is such a thing as never happened afore i do rightly believe them’ly my darling come here come here my little witch there is mas’r davy’s friend my dear there is the gent’lman as you have heerd on them’ly he comes to see you along with mas’r davy on the brightest night of your uncle’s life as ever was or will be gorm the t’other one and horroar for it’ after delivering this speech all in a breath and with extraordinary animation and pleasure mr peggotty put one of his large hands rapturously on each side of his niece’s face and kissing it a dozen times laid it with a gentle pride and love upon his broad chest and patted it as if his hand had been a lady’s then he let her go and as she ran into the little chamber where i used to sleep looked round upon us quite hot and out of breath with his uncommon satisfaction ‘if you two gent’lmengent’lmen growed now and such gent’lmen’ said mr peggotty ‘so th’ are so th’ are’ cried ham ‘well said so th’ are mas’r davy bor’gent’lmen growedso th’ are’ ‘if you two gent’lmen gent’lmen growed’ said mr peggotty ‘do not excuse me for being in a state of mind when you understand matters i will arks your pardon them’ly my dearshe knows i am a going to tell’ here his delight broke out again ‘and has made off would you be so good as look arter her mawther for a minute’ mrs gummidge nodded and disappeared ‘if this are not’ said mr peggotty sitting down among us by the fire ‘the brightest night of my life i am a shellfishbiled tooand more i cannot say this here little them’ly sir’ in a low voice to steerforth ‘her as you see a blushing here just now’ steerforth only nodded but with such a pleased expression of interest and of participation in mr peggotty’s feelings that the latter answered him as if he had spoken ‘to be sure’ said mr peggotty ‘that is her and so she is thankee sir’ ham nodded to me several times as if he would have said so too ‘this here little them’ly of ours’ said mr peggotty ‘has been in our house what i suppose i am a ignorant man but that is my belief no one but a little brighteyed creetur can be in a house she are not my child i never had one but i could not love her more you understand i could not do it’ ‘i quite understand’ said steerforth ‘i know you do sir’ returned mr peggotty ‘and thankee again mas’r davy he can remember what she was you may judge for your own self what she is but neither of you cannot fully know what she has been is and will be to my loving art i am rough sir’ said mr peggotty ‘i am as rough as a sea porkypine but no one unless mayhap it is a woman can know i think what our little them’ly is to me and betwixt ourselves’ sinking his voice lower yet ‘that woman’s name are not missis gummidge neither though she has a world of merits’ mr peggotty ruffled his hair again with both hands as a further preparation for what he was going to say and went on with a hand upon each of his knees ‘there was a certain person as had know’d our them’ly from the time when her father was drownded as had seen her constant when a babby when a young gal when a woman not much of a person to look at he warn’t’ said mr peggotty ‘something of my own buildrougha good deal of the sou’wester in himwery saltbut on the whole a honest sort of a chap with his art in the right place’ i thought i had never seen ham grin to anything like the extent to which he sat grinning at us now ‘what does this here blessed tarpaulin go and do’ said mr peggotty with his face one high noon of enjoyment ‘but he loses that there art of his to our little them’ly he follers her about he makes hisself a sort of servant to her he loses in a great measure his relish for his wittles and in the longrun he makes it clear to me wot’s amiss now i could wish myself you see that our little them’ly was in a fair way of being married i could wish to see her at all ewents under articles to a honest man as had a right to defend her i do not know how long i may live or how soon i may die but i know that if i was capsized any night in a gale of wind in yarmouth roads here and was to see the townlights shining for the last time over the rollers as i could not make no head against i could go down quieter for thinking “there is a man ashore there irontrue to my little them’ly god bless her and no wrong can touch my them’ly while so be as that man lives”’ mr peggotty in simple earnestness waved his right arm as if he were waving it at the townlights for the last time and then exchanging a nod with ham whose eye he caught proceeded as before ‘well i counsels him to speak to them’ly he is big enough but he is bashfuller than a little un and he do not like so i speak “what him” says them’ly “him that i have know’d so intimate so many years and like so much oh uncle i never can have him he is such a good fellow” i gives her a kiss and i says no more to her than “my dear you are right to speak out you are to choose for yourself you are as free as a little bird” then i aways to him and i says “i wish it could have been so but it cannot but you can both be as you was and wot i say to you is be as you was with her like a man” he says to me ashaking of my hand “i will” he says and he washonourable and manfulfor two year going on and we was just the same at home here as afore’ mr peggotty’s face which had varied in its expression with the various stages of his narrative now resumed all its former triumphant delight as he laid a hand upon my knee and a hand upon steerforth’s previously wetting them both for the greater emphasis of the action and divided the following speech between us ‘all of a sudden one eveningas it might be tonightcomes little them’ly from her work and him with her there are not so much in that you will say no because he takes care on her like a brother arter dark and indeed afore dark and at all times but this tarpaulin chap he takes hold of her hand and he cries out to me joyful “look here this is to be my little wife” and she says half bold and half shy and half a laughing and half a crying “yes uncle if you please”if i please’ cried mr peggotty rolling his head in an ecstasy at the idea ‘lord as if i should do anythink else“if you please i am steadier now and i have thought better of it and i will be as good a little wife as i can to him for he is a dear good fellow” then missis gummidge she claps her hands like a play and you come in theer the murder’s out’ said mr peggotty‘you come in it took place this here present hour and here is the man that will marry her the minute she is out of her time’ ham staggered as well he might under the blow mr peggotty dealt him in his unbounded joy as a mark of confidence and friendship but feeling called upon to say something to us he said with much faltering and great difficulty ‘she warn’t no higher than you was mas’r davywhen you first comewhen i thought what she would grow up to be i see her grown upgent’lmenlike a flower i would lay down my life for hermas’r davyoh most content and cheerful she is more to megent’lmenthanshe is all to me that ever i can want and more than ever ithan ever i could say ii love her true there are not a gent’lman in all the landnor yet sailing upon all the seathat can love his lady more than i love her though there is many a common manwould say betterwhat he meant’ i thought it affecting to see such a sturdy fellow as ham was now trembling in the strength of what he felt for the pretty little creature who had won his heart i thought the simple confidence reposed in us by mr peggotty and by himself was in itself affecting i was affected by the story altogether how far my emotions were influenced by the recollections of my childhood i do not know whether i had come there with any lingering fancy that i was still to love little them’ly i do not know i know that i was filled with pleasure by all this but at first with an indescribably sensitive pleasure that a very little would have changed to pain therefore if it had depended upon me to touch the prevailing chord among them with any skill i should have made a poor hand of it but it depended upon steerforth and he did it with such address that in a few minutes we were all as easy and as happy as it was possible to be ‘mr peggotty’ he said ‘you are a thoroughly good fellow and deserve to be as happy as you are tonight my hand upon it ham i give you joy my boy my hand upon that too daisy stir the fire and make it a brisk one and mr peggotty unless you can induce your gentle niece to come back for whom i vacate this seat in the corner i shall go any gap at your fireside on such a nightsuch a gap least of alli would not make for the wealth of the indies’ so mr peggotty went into my old room to fetch little them’ly at first little them’ly did not like to come and then ham went presently they brought her to the fireside very much confused and very shybut she soon became more assured when she found how gently and respectfully steerforth spoke to her how skilfully he avoided anything that would embarrass her how he talked to mr peggotty of boats and ships and tides and fish how he referred to me about the time when he had seen mr peggotty at salem house how delighted he was with the boat and all belonging to it how lightly and easily he carried on until he brought us by degrees into a charmed circle and we were all talking away without any reserve them’ly indeed said little all the evening but she looked and listened and her face got animated and she was charming steerforth told a story of a dismal shipwreck which arose out of his talk with mr peggotty as if he saw it all before himand little them’ly’s eyes were fastened on him all the time as if she saw it too he told us a merry adventure of his own as a relief to that with as much gaiety as if the narrative were as fresh to him as it was to usand little them’ly laughed until the boat rang with the musical sounds and we all laughed steerforth too in irresistible sympathy with what was so pleasant and lighthearted he got mr peggotty to sing or rather to roar ‘when the stormy winds do blow do blow do blow’ and he sang a sailor’s song himself so pathetically and beautifully that i could have almost fancied that the real wind creeping sorrowfully round the house and murmuring low through our unbroken silence was there to listen as to mrs gummidge he roused that victim of despondency with a success never attained by anyone else so mr peggotty informed me since the decease of the old one he left her so little leisure for being miserable that she said next day she thought she must have been bewitched but he set up no monopoly of the general attention or the conversation when little them’ly grew more courageous and talked but still bashfully across the fire to me of our old wanderings upon the beach to pick up shells and pebbles and when i asked her if she recollected how i used to be devoted to her and when we both laughed and reddened casting these looks back on the pleasant old times so unreal to look at now he was silent and attentive and observed us thoughtfully she sat at this time and all the evening on the old locker in her old little corner by the fireham beside her where i used to sit i could not satisfy myself whether it was in her own little tormenting way or in a maidenly reserve before us that she kept quite close to the wall and away from him but i observed that she did so all the evening as i remember it was almost midnight when we took our leave we had had some biscuit and dried fish for supper and steerforth had produced from his pocket a full flask of hollands which we men i may say we men now without a blush had emptied we parted merrily and as they all stood crowded round the door to light us as far as they could upon our road i saw the sweet blue eyes of little them’ly peeping after us from behind ham and heard her soft voice calling to us to be careful how we went ‘a most engaging little beauty’ said steerforth taking my arm ‘well it is a quaint place and they are quaint company and it is quite a new sensation to mix with them’ ‘how fortunate we are too’ i returned ‘to have arrived to witness their happiness in that intended marriage i never saw people so happy how delightful to see it and to be made the sharers in their honest joy as we have been’ ‘that is rather a chuckleheaded fellow for the girl is not he’ said steerforth he had been so hearty with him and with them all that i felt a shock in this unexpected and cold reply but turning quickly upon him and seeing a laugh in his eyes i answered much relieved ‘ah steerforth it is well for you to joke about the poor you may skirmish with miss dartle or try to hide your sympathies in jest from me but i know better when i see how perfectly you understand them how exquisitely you can enter into happiness like this plain fisherman’s or humour a love like my old nurse’s i know that there is not a joy or sorrow not an emotion of such people that can be indifferent to you and i admire and love you for it steerforth twenty times the more’ he stopped and looking in my face said ‘daisy i believe you are in earnest and are good i wish we all were’ next moment he was gaily singing mr peggotty’s song as we walked at a round pace back to yarmouth
