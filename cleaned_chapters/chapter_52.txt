i assist at an explosion when the time mr micawber had appointed so mysteriously was within fourandtwenty hours of being come my aunt and i consulted how we should proceed for my aunt was very unwilling to leave dora ah how easily i carried dora up and down stairs now we were disposed notwithstanding mr micawber’s stipulation for my aunt’s attendance to arrange that she should stay at home and be represented by mr dick and me in short we had resolved to take this course when dora again unsettled us by declaring that she never would forgive herself and never would forgive her bad boy if my aunt remained behind on any pretence ‘i will not speak to you’ said dora shaking her curls at my aunt ‘i will be disagreeable i will make jip bark at you all day i shall be sure that you really are a cross old thing if you do not go’ ‘tut blossom’ laughed my aunt ‘you know you cannot do without me’ ‘yes i can’ said dora ‘you are no use to me at all you never run up and down stairs for me all day long you never sit and tell me stories about doady when his shoes were worn out and he was covered with dustoh what a poor little mite of a fellow you never do anything at all to please me do you dear’ dora made haste to kiss my aunt and say ‘yes you do i am only joking’lest my aunt should think she really meant it ‘but aunt’ said dora coaxingly ‘now listen you must go i shall tease you ‘till you let me have my own way about it i shall lead my naughty boy such a life if he do not make you go i shall make myself so disagreeableand so will jip you will wish you had gone like a good thing for ever and ever so long if you do not go besides’ said dora putting back her hair and looking wonderingly at my aunt and me ‘why should not you both go i am not very ill indeed am i’ ‘why what a question’ cried my aunt ‘what a fancy’ said i ‘yes i know i am a silly little thing’ said dora slowly looking from one of us to the other and then putting up her pretty lips to kiss us as she lay upon her couch ‘well then you must both go or i shall not believe you and then i shall cry’ i saw in my aunt’s face that she began to give way now and dora brightened again as she saw it too ‘you will come back with so much to tell me that it will take at least a week to make me understand’ said dora ‘because i know i shall not understand for a length of time if there is any business in it and there is sure to be some business in it if there is anything to add up besides i do not know when i shall make it out and my bad boy will look so miserable all the time there now you will go will not you you will only be gone one night and jip will take care of me while you are gone doady will carry me upstairs before you go and i will not come down again till you come back and you shall take agnes a dreadfully scolding letter from me because she has never been to see us’ we agreed without any more consultation that we would both go and that dora was a little impostor who feigned to be rather unwell because she liked to be petted she was greatly pleased and very merry and we four that is to say my aunt mr dick traddles and i went down to canterbury by the dover mail that night at the hotel where mr micawber had requested us to await him which we got into with some trouble in the middle of the night i found a letter importing that he would appear in the morning punctually at half past nine after which we went shivering at that uncomfortable hour to our respective beds through various close passages which smelt as if they had been steeped for ages in a solution of soup and stables early in the morning i sauntered through the dear old tranquil streets and again mingled with the shadows of the venerable gateways and churches the rooks were sailing about the cathedral towers and the towers themselves overlooking many a long unaltered mile of the rich country and its pleasant streams were cutting the bright morning air as if there were no such thing as change on earth yet the bells when they sounded told me sorrowfully of change in everything told me of their own age and my pretty dora’s youth and of the many never old who had lived and loved and died while the reverberations of the bells had hummed through the rusty armour of the black prince hanging up within and motes upon the deep of time had lost themselves in air as circles do in water i looked at the old house from the corner of the street but did not go nearer to it lest being observed i might unwittingly do any harm to the design i had come to aid the early sun was striking edgewise on its gables and latticewindows touching them with gold and some beams of its old peace seemed to touch my heart i strolled into the country for an hour or so and then returned by the main street which in the interval had shaken off its last night’s sleep among those who were stirring in the shops i saw my ancient enemy the butcher now advanced to topboots and a baby and in business for himself he was nursing the baby and appeared to be a benignant member of society we all became very anxious and impatient when we sat down to breakfast as it approached nearer and nearer to half past nine of the clock our restless expectation of mr micawber increased at last we made no more pretence of attending to the meal which except with mr dick had been a mere form from the first but my aunt walked up and down the room traddles sat upon the sofa affecting to read the paper with his eyes on the ceiling and i looked out of the window to give early notice of mr micawber’s coming nor had i long to watch for at the first chime of the half hour he appeared in the street ‘here he is’ said i ‘and not in his legal attire’ my aunt tied the strings of her bonnet she had come down to breakfast in it and put on her shawl as if she were ready for anything that was resolute and uncompromising traddles buttoned his coat with a determined air mr dick disturbed by these formidable appearances but feeling it necessary to imitate them pulled his hat with both hands as firmly over his ears as he possibly could and instantly took it off again to welcome mr micawber ‘gentlemen and madam’ said mr micawber ‘good morning my dear sir’ to mr dick who shook hands with him violently ‘you are extremely good’ ‘have you breakfasted’ said mr dick ‘have a chop’ ‘not for the world my good sir’ cried mr micawber stopping him on his way to the bell ‘appetite and myself mr dixon have long been strangers’ mr dixon was so well pleased with his new name and appeared to think it so obliging in mr micawber to confer it upon him that he shook hands with him again and laughed rather childishly ‘dick’ said my aunt ‘attention’ mr dick recovered himself with a blush ‘now sir’ said my aunt to mr micawber as she put on her gloves ‘we are ready for mount vesuvius or anything else as soon as you please’ ‘madam’ returned mr micawber ‘i trust you will shortly witness an eruption mr traddles i have your permission i believe to mention here that we have been in communication together’ ‘it is undoubtedly the fact copperfield’ said traddles to whom i looked in surprise ‘mr micawber has consulted me in reference to what he has in contemplation and i have advised him to the best of my judgement’ ‘unless i deceive myself mr traddles’ pursued mr micawber ‘what i contemplate is a disclosure of an important nature’ ‘highly so’ said traddles ‘perhaps under such circumstances madam and gentlemen’ said mr micawber ‘you will do me the favour to submit yourselves for the moment to the direction of one who however unworthy to be regarded in any other light but as a waif and stray upon the shore of human nature is still your fellowman though crushed out of his original form by individual errors and the accumulative force of a combination of circumstances’ ‘we have perfect confidence in you mr micawber’ said i ‘and will do what you please’ ‘mr copperfield’ returned mr micawber ‘your confidence is not at the existing juncture illbestowed i would beg to be allowed a start of five minutes by the clock and then to receive the present company inquiring for miss wickfield at the office of wickfield and heep whose stipendiary i am’ my aunt and i looked at traddles who nodded his approval ‘i have no more’ observed mr micawber ‘to say at present’ with which to my infinite surprise he included us all in a comprehensive bow and disappeared his manner being extremely distant and his face extremely pale traddles only smiled and shook his head with his hair standing upright on the top of it when i looked to him for an explanation so i took out my watch and as a last resource counted off the five minutes my aunt with her own watch in her hand did the like when the time was expired traddles gave her his arm and we all went out together to the old house without saying one word on the way we found mr micawber at his desk in the turret office on the ground floor either writing or pretending to write hard the large officeruler was stuck into his waistcoat and was not so well concealed but that a foot or more of that instrument protruded from his bosom like a new kind of shirtfrill as it appeared to me that i was expected to speak i said aloud ‘how do you do mr micawber’ ‘mr copperfield’ said mr micawber gravely ‘i hope i see you well’ ‘is miss wickfield at home’ said i ‘mr wickfield is unwell in bed sir of a rheumatic fever’ he returned ‘but miss wickfield i have no doubt will be happy to see old friends will you walk in sir’ he preceded us to the diningroomthe first room i had entered in that houseand flinging open the door of mr wickfield’s former office said in a sonorous voice ‘miss trotwood mr david copperfield mr thomas traddles and mr dixon’ i had not seen uriah heep since the time of the blow our visit astonished him evidently not the less i dare say because it astonished ourselves he did not gather his eyebrows together for he had none worth mentioning but he frowned to that degree that he almost closed his small eyes while the hurried raising of his grisly hand to his chin betrayed some trepidation or surprise this was only when we were in the act of entering his room and when i caught a glance at him over my aunt’s shoulder a moment afterwards he was as fawning and as humble as ever ‘well i am sure’ he said ‘this is indeed an unexpected pleasure to have as i may say all friends round st paul’s at once is a treat unlooked for mr copperfield i hope i see you well andif i may umbly express myself sofriendly towards them as is ever your friends whether or not mrs copperfield sir i hope she is getting on we have been made quite uneasy by the poor accounts we have had of her state lately i do assure you’ i felt ashamed to let him take my hand but i did not know yet what else to do ‘things are changed in this office miss trotwood since i was an umble clerk and held your pony are not they’ said uriah with his sickliest smile ‘but i am not changed miss trotwood’ ‘well sir’ returned my aunt ‘to tell you the truth i think you are pretty constant to the promise of your youth if that is any satisfaction to you’ ‘thank you miss trotwood’ said uriah writhing in his ungainly manner ‘for your good opinion micawber tell ‘them to let miss agnes knowand mother mother will be quite in a state when she sees the present company’ said uriah setting chairs ‘you are not busy mr heep’ said traddles whose eye the cunning red eye accidentally caught as it at once scrutinized and evaded us ‘no mr traddles’ replied uriah resuming his official seat and squeezing his bony hands laid palm to palm between his bony knees ‘not so much so as i could wish but lawyers sharks and leeches are not easily satisfied you know not but what myself and micawber have our hands pretty full in general on account of mr wickfield’s being hardly fit for any occupation sir but it is a pleasure as well as a duty i am sure to work for him you have not been intimate with mr wickfield i think mr traddles i believe i have only had the honour of seeing you once myself’ ‘no i have not been intimate with mr wickfield’ returned traddles ‘or i might perhaps have waited on you long ago mr heep’ there was something in the tone of this reply which made uriah look at the speaker again with a very sinister and suspicious expression but seeing only traddles with his goodnatured face simple manner and hair on end he dismissed it as he replied with a jerk of his whole body but especially his throat ‘i am sorry for that mr traddles you would have admired him as much as we all do his little failings would only have endeared him to you the more but if you would like to hear my fellowpartner eloquently spoken of i should refer you to copperfield the family is a subject he is very strong upon if you never heard him’ i was prevented from disclaiming the compliment if i should have done so in any case by the entrance of agnes now ushered in by mr micawber she was not quite so selfpossessed as usual i thought and had evidently undergone anxiety and fatigue but her earnest cordiality and her quiet beauty shone with the gentler lustre for it i saw uriah watch her while she greeted us and he reminded me of an ugly and rebellious genie watching a good spirit in the meanwhile some slight sign passed between mr micawber and traddles and traddles unobserved except by me went out ‘do not wait micawber’ said uriah mr micawber with his hand upon the ruler in his breast stood erect before the door most unmistakably contemplating one of his fellowmen and that man his employer ‘what are you waiting for’ said uriah ‘micawber did you hear me tell you not to wait’ ‘yes’ replied the immovable mr micawber ‘then why do you wait’ said uriah ‘because iin short choose’ replied mr micawber with a burst uriah’s cheeks lost colour and an unwholesome paleness still faintly tinged by his pervading red overspread them he looked at mr micawber attentively with his whole face breathing short and quick in every feature ‘you are a dissipated fellow as all the world knows’ he said with an effort at a smile ‘and i am afraid you will oblige me to get rid of you go along i will talk to you presently’ ‘if there is a scoundrel on this earth’ said mr micawber suddenly breaking out again with the utmost vehemence ‘with whom i have already talked too much that scoundrel’s name isheep’ uriah fell back as if he had been struck or stung looking slowly round upon us with the darkest and wickedest expression that his face could wear he said in a lower voice ‘oho this is a conspiracy you have met here by appointment you are playing booty with my clerk are you copperfield now take care you will make nothing of this we understand each other you and me there is no love between us you were always a puppy with a proud stomach from your first coming here and you envy me my rise do you none of your plots against me i will counterplot you micawber you be off i will talk to you presently’ ‘mr micawber’ said i ‘there is a sudden change in this fellow in more respects than the extraordinary one of his speaking the truth in one particular which assures me that he is brought to bay deal with him as he deserves’ ‘you are a precious set of people are not you’ said uriah in the same low voice and breaking out into a clammy heat which he wiped from his forehead with his long lean hand ‘to buy over my clerk who is the very scum of societyas you yourself were copperfield you know it before anyone had charity on youto defame me with his lies miss trotwood you had better stop this or i will stop your husband shorter than will be pleasant to you i will not know your story professionally for nothing old lady miss wickfield if you have any love for your father you had better not join that gang i will ruin him if you do now come i have got some of you under the harrow think twice before it goes over you think twice you micawber if you do not want to be crushed i recommend you to take yourself off and be talked to presently you fool while there is time to retreat where is mother’ he said suddenly appearing to notice with alarm the absence of traddles and pulling down the bellrope ‘fine doings in a person’s own house’ ‘mrs heep is here sir’ said traddles returning with that worthy mother of a worthy son ‘i have taken the liberty of making myself known to her’ ‘who are you to make yourself known’ retorted uriah ‘and what do you want here’ ‘i am the agent and friend of mr wickfield sir’ said traddles in a composed and businesslike way ‘and i have a power of attorney from him in my pocket to act for him in all matters’ ‘the old ass has drunk himself into a state of dotage’ said uriah turning uglier than before ‘and it has been got from him by fraud’ ‘something has been got from him by fraud i know’ returned traddles quietly ‘and so do you mr heep we will refer that question if you please to mr micawber’ ‘ury’ mrs heep began with an anxious gesture ‘you hold your tongue mother’ he returned ‘least said soonest mended’ ‘but my ury’ ‘will you hold your tongue mother and leave it to me’ though i had long known that his servility was false and all his pretences knavish and hollow i had had no adequate conception of the extent of his hypocrisy until i now saw him with his mask off the suddenness with which he dropped it when he perceived that it was useless to him the malice insolence and hatred he revealed the leer with which he exulted even at this moment in the evil he had doneall this time being desperate too and at his wits’ end for the means of getting the better of usthough perfectly consistent with the experience i had of him at first took even me by surprise who had known him so long and disliked him so heartily i say nothing of the look he conferred on me as he stood eyeing us one after another for i had always understood that he hated me and i remembered the marks of my hand upon his cheek but when his eyes passed on to agnes and i saw the rage with which he felt his power over her slipping away and the exhibition in their disappointment of the odious passions that had led him to aspire to one whose virtues he could never appreciate or care for i was shocked by the mere thought of her having lived an hour within sight of such a man after some rubbing of the lower part of his face and some looking at us with those bad eyes over his grisly fingers he made one more address to me half whining and half abusive ‘you think it justifiable do you copperfield you who pride yourself so much on your honour and all the rest of it to sneak about my place eavesdropping with my clerk if it had been me i should not have wondered for i do not make myself out a gentleman though i never was in the streets either as you were according to micawber but being youand you are not afraid of doing this either you do not think at all of what i shall do in return or of getting yourself into trouble for conspiracy and so forth very well we shall see mr what isyourname you were going to refer some question to micawber there is your referee why do not you make him speak he has learnt his lesson i see’ seeing that what he said had no effect on me or any of us he sat on the edge of his table with his hands in his pockets and one of his splay feet twisted round the other leg waiting doggedly for what might follow mr micawber whose impetuosity i had restrained thus far with the greatest difficulty and who had repeatedly interposed with the first syllable of scoundrel without getting to the second now burst forward drew the ruler from his breast apparently as a defensive weapon and produced from his pocket a foolscap document folded in the form of a large letter opening this packet with his old flourish and glancing at the contents as if he cherished an artistic admiration of their style of composition he began to read as follows ‘“dear miss trotwood and gentlemen“’ ‘bless and save the man’ exclaimed my aunt in a low voice ‘he would write letters by the ream if it was a capital offence’ mr micawber without hearing her went on ‘“in appearing before you to denounce probably the most consummate villain that has ever existed”’ mr micawber without looking off the letter pointed the ruler like a ghostly truncheon at uriah heep ‘“i ask no consideration for myself the victim from my cradle of pecuniary liabilities to which i have been unable to respond i have ever been the sport and toy of debasing circumstances ignominy want despair and madness have collectively or separately been the attendants of my career”’ the relish with which mr micawber described himself as a prey to these dismal calamities was only to be equalled by the emphasis with which he read his letter and the kind of homage he rendered to it with a roll of his head when he thought he had hit a sentence very hard indeed ‘“in an accumulation of ignominy want despair and madness i entered the officeor as our lively neighbour the gaul would term it the bureauof the firm nominally conducted under the appellation of wickfield andheep but in reality wielded byheep alone heep and only heep is the mainspring of that machine heep and only heep is the forger and the cheat”’ uriah more blue than white at these words made a dart at the letter as if to tear it in pieces mr micawber with a perfect miracle of dexterity or luck caught his advancing knuckles with the ruler and disabled his right hand it dropped at the wrist as if it were broken the blow sounded as if it had fallen on wood ‘the devil take you’ said uriah writhing in a new way with pain ‘i will be even with you’ ‘approach me again youyouyou heep of infamy’ gasped mr micawber ‘and if your head is human i will break it come on come on’ i think i never saw anything more ridiculousi was sensible of it even at the timethan mr micawber making broadsword guards with the ruler and crying ‘come on’ while traddles and i pushed him back into a corner from which as often as we got him into it he persisted in emerging again his enemy muttering to himself after wringing his wounded hand for sometime slowly drew off his neckkerchief and bound it up then held it in his other hand and sat upon his table with his sullen face looking down mr micawber when he was sufficiently cool proceeded with his letter ‘“the stipendiary emoluments in consideration of which i entered into the service ofheep”’ always pausing before that word and uttering it with astonishing vigour ‘“were not defined beyond the pittance of twentytwo shillings and six per week the rest was left contingent on the value of my professional exertions in other and more expressive words on the baseness of my nature the cupidity of my motives the poverty of my family the general moral or rather immoral resemblance between myself andheep need i say that it soon became necessary for me to solicit fromheeppecuniary advances towards the support of mrs micawber and our blighted but rising family need i say that this necessity had been foreseen byheep that those advances were secured by ioyou’s and other similar acknowledgements known to the legal institutions of this country and that i thus became immeshed in the web he had spun for my reception”’ mr micawber’s enjoyment of his epistolary powers in describing this unfortunate state of things really seemed to outweigh any pain or anxiety that the reality could have caused him he read on ‘“then it was thatheepbegan to favour me with just so much of his confidence as was necessary to the discharge of his infernal business then it was that i began if i may so shakespearianly express myself to dwindle peak and pine i found that my services were constantly called into requisition for the falsification of business and the mystification of an individual whom i will designate as mr w that mr w was imposed upon kept in ignorance and deluded in every possible way yet that all this while the ruffianheepwas professing unbounded gratitude to and unbounded friendship for that muchabused gentleman this was bad enough but as the philosophic dane observes with that universal applicability which distinguishes the illustrious ornament of the elizabethan era worse remains behind”’ mr micawber was so very much struck by this happy rounding off with a quotation that he indulged himself and us with a second reading of the sentence under pretence of having lost his place ‘“it is not my intention”’ he continued reading on ‘“to enter on a detailed list within the compass of the present epistle though it is ready elsewhere of the various malpractices of a minor nature affecting the individual whom i have denominated mr w to which i have been a tacitly consenting party my object when the contest within myself between stipend and no stipend baker and no baker existence and nonexistence ceased was to take advantage of my opportunities to discover and expose the major malpractices committed to that gentleman’s grievous wrong and injury byheep stimulated by the silent monitor within and by a no less touching and appealing monitor withoutto whom i will briefly refer as miss wi entered on a not unlaborious task of clandestine investigation protractednow to the best of my knowledge information and belief over a period exceeding twelve calendar months”’ he read this passage as if it were from an act of parliament and appeared majestically refreshed by the sound of the words ‘“my charges againstheep”’ he read on glancing at him and drawing the ruler into a convenient position under his left arm in case of need ‘“are as follows”’ we all held our breath i think i am sure uriah held his ‘“first”’ said mr micawber ‘“when mr w’s faculties and memory for business became through causes into which it is not necessary or expedient for me to enter weakened and confusedheepdesignedly perplexed and complicated the whole of the official transactions when mr w was least fit to enter on businessheep was always at hand to force him to enter on it he obtained mr w’s signature under such circumstances to documents of importance representing them to be other documents of no importance he induced mr w to empower him to draw out thus one particular sum of trustmoney amounting to twelve six fourteen two and nine and employed it to meet pretended business charges and deficiencies which were either already provided for or had never really existed he gave this proceeding throughout the appearance of having originated in mr w’s own dishonest intention and of having been accomplished by mr w’s own dishonest act and has used it ever since to torture and constrain him”’ ‘you shall prove this you copperfield’ said uriah with a threatening shake of the head ‘all in good time’ ‘askheepmr traddles who lived in his house after him’ said mr micawber breaking off from the letter ‘will you’ ‘the fool himselfand lives there now’ said uriah disdainfully ‘askheepif he ever kept a pocketbook in that house’ said mr micawber ‘will you’ i saw uriah’s lank hand stop involuntarily in the scraping of his chin ‘or ask him’ said mr micawber ‘if he ever burnt one there if he says yes and asks you where the ashes are refer him to wilkins micawber and he will hear of something not at all to his advantage’ the triumphant flourish with which mr micawber delivered himself of these words had a powerful effect in alarming the mother who cried out in much agitation ‘ury ury be umble and make terms my dear’ ‘mother’ he retorted ‘will you keep quiet you are in a fright and do not know what you say or mean umble’ he repeated looking at me with a snarl ‘i have umbled some of ‘them for a pretty long time back umble as i was’ mr micawber genteelly adjusting his chin in his cravat presently proceeded with his composition ‘“second heep has on several occasions to the best of my knowledge information and belief“’ ‘but that will not do’ muttered uriah relieved ‘mother you keep quiet’ ‘we will endeavour to provide something that will do and do for you finally sir very shortly’ replied mr micawber ‘“second heep has on several occasions to the best of my knowledge information and belief systematically forged to various entries books and documents the signature of mr w and has distinctly done so in one instance capable of proof by me to wit in manner following that is to say”’ again mr micawber had a relish in this formal piling up of words which however ludicrously displayed in his case was i must say not at all peculiar to him i have observed it in the course of my life in numbers of men it seems to me to be a general rule in the taking of legal oaths for instance deponents seem to enjoy themselves mightily when they come to several good words in succession for the expression of one idea as that they utterly detest abominate and abjure or so forth and the old anathemas were made relishing on the same principle we talk about the tyranny of words but we like to tyrannize over them too we are fond of having a large superfluous establishment of words to wait upon us on great occasions we think it looks important and sounds well as we are not particular about the meaning of our liveries on state occasions if they be but fine and numerous enough so the meaning or necessity of our words is a secondary consideration if there be but a great parade of them and as individuals get into trouble by making too great a show of liveries or as slaves when they are too numerous rise against their masters so i think i could mention a nation that has got into many great difficulties and will get into many greater from maintaining too large a retinue of words mr micawber read on almost smacking his lips ‘“to wit in manner following that is to say mr w being infirm and it being within the bounds of probability that his decease might lead to some discoveries and to the downfall ofheep’spower over the w familyas i wilkins micawber the undersigned assumeunless the filial affection of his daughter could be secretly influenced from allowing any investigation of the partnership affairs to be ever made the saidheepdeemed it expedient to have a bond ready by him as from mr w for the beforementioned sum of twelve six fourteen two and nine with interest stated therein to have been advanced byheepto mr w to save mr w from dishonour though really the sum was never advanced by him and has long been replaced the signatures to this instrument purporting to be executed by mr w and attested by wilkins micawber are forgeries byheep i have in my possession in his hand and pocketbook several similar imitations of mr w’s signature here and there defaced by fire but legible to anyone i never attested any such document and i have the document itself in my possession”’ uriah heep with a start took out of his pocket a bunch of keys and opened a certain drawer then suddenly bethought himself of what he was about and turned again towards us without looking in it ‘“and i have the document”’ mr micawber read again looking about as if it were the text of a sermon ‘“in my possessionthat is to say i had early this morning when this was written but have since relinquished it to mr traddles”’ ‘it is quite true’ assented traddles ‘ury ury’ cried the mother ‘be umble and make terms i know my son will be umble gentlemen if you will give him time to think mr copperfield i am sure you know that he was always very umble sir’ it was singular to see how the mother still held to the old trick when the son had abandoned it as useless ‘mother’ he said with an impatient bite at the handkerchief in which his hand was wrapped ‘you had better take and fire a loaded gun at me’ ‘but i love you ury’ cried mrs heep and i have no doubt she did or that he loved her however strange it may appear though to be sure they were a congenial couple ‘and i cannot bear to hear you provoking the gentlemen and endangering of yourself more i told the gentleman at first when he told me upstairs it was come to light that i would answer for your being umble and making amends oh see how umble i am gentlemen and do not mind him’ ‘why there is copperfield mother’ he angrily retorted pointing his lean finger at me against whom all his animosity was levelled as the prime mover in the discovery and i did not undeceive him ‘there is copperfield would have given you a hundred pound to say less than you have blurted out’ ‘i cannot help it ury’ cried his mother ‘i cannot see you running into danger through carrying your head so high better be umble as you always was’ he remained for a little biting the handkerchief and then said to me with a scowl ‘what more have you got to bring forward if anything go on with it what do you look at me for’ mr micawber promptly resumed his letter glad to revert to a performance with which he was so highly satisfied ‘“third and last i am now in a condition to show byheep’sfalse books andheep’sreal memoranda beginning with the partially destroyed pocketbook which i was unable to comprehend at the time of its accidental discovery by mrs micawber on our taking possession of our present abode in the locker or bin devoted to the reception of the ashes calcined on our domestic hearth that the weaknesses the faults the very virtues the parental affections and the sense of honour of the unhappy mr w have been for years acted on by and warped to the base purposes ofheep that mr w has been for years deluded and plundered in every conceivable manner to the pecuniary aggrandisement of the avaricious false and graspingheep that the engrossing object ofheepwas next to gain to subdue mr and miss w of his ulterior views in reference to the latter i say nothing entirely to himself that his last act completed but a few months since was to induce mr w to execute a relinquishment of his share in the partnership and even a bill of sale on the very furniture of his house in consideration of a certain annuity to be well and truly paid byheepon the four common quarterdays in each and every year that these meshes beginning with alarming and falsified accounts of the estate of which mr w is the receiver at a period when mr w had launched into imprudent and illjudged speculations and may not have had the money for which he was morally and legally responsible in hand going on with pretended borrowings of money at enormous interest really coming fromheepand byheepfraudulently obtained or withheld from mr w himself on pretence of such speculations or otherwise perpetuated by a miscellaneous catalogue of unscrupulous chicaneriesgradually thickened until the unhappy mr w could see no world beyond bankrupt as he believed alike in circumstances in all other hope and in honour his sole reliance was upon the monster in the garb of man”’mr micawber made a good deal of this as a new turn of expression‘“who by making himself necessary to him had achieved his destruction all this i undertake to show probably much more”’ i whispered a few words to agnes who was weeping half joyfully half sorrowfully at my side and there was a movement among us as if mr micawber had finished he said with exceeding gravity ‘pardon me’ and proceeded with a mixture of the lowest spirits and the most intense enjoyment to the peroration of his letter ‘“i have now concluded it merely remains for me to substantiate these accusations and then with my illstarred family to disappear from the landscape on which we appear to be an encumbrance that is soon done it may be reasonably inferred that our baby will first expire of inanition as being the frailest member of our circle and that our twins will follow next in order so be it for myself my canterbury pilgrimage has done much imprisonment on civil process and want will soon do more i trust that the labour and hazard of an investigationof which the smallest results have been slowly pieced together in the pressure of arduous avocations under grinding penurious apprehensions at rise of morn at dewy eve in the shadows of night under the watchful eye of one whom it were superfluous to call demoncombined with the struggle of parental poverty to turn it when completed to the right account may be as the sprinkling of a few drops of sweet water on my funeral pyre i ask no more let it be in justice merely said of me as of a gallant and eminent naval hero with whom i have no pretensions to cope that what i have done i did in despite of mercenary and selfish objects for england home and beauty ‘“remaining always c c wilkins micawber”’ much affected but still intensely enjoying himself mr micawber folded up his letter and handed it with a bow to my aunt as something she might like to keep there was as i had noticed on my first visit long ago an iron safe in the room the key was in it a hasty suspicion seemed to strike uriah and with a glance at mr micawber he went to it and threw the doors clanking open it was empty ‘where are the books’ he cried with a frightful face ‘some thief has stolen the books’ mr micawber tapped himself with the ruler ‘i did when i got the key from you as usualbut a little earlierand opened it this morning’ ‘do not be uneasy’ said traddles ‘they have come into my possession i will take care of them under the authority i mentioned’ ‘you receive stolen goods do you’ cried uriah ‘under such circumstances’ answered traddles ‘yes’ what was my astonishment when i beheld my aunt who had been profoundly quiet and attentive make a dart at uriah heep and seize him by the collar with both hands ‘you know what i want’ said my aunt ‘a straitwaistcoat’ said he ‘no my property’ returned my aunt ‘agnes my dear as long as i believed it had been really made away with by your father i would notand my dear i did not even to trot as he knowsbreathe a syllable of its having been placed here for investment but now i know this fellow’s answerable for it and i will have it trot come and take it away from him’ whether my aunt supposed for the moment that he kept her property in his neckkerchief i am sure i do not know but she certainly pulled at it as if she thought so i hastened to put myself between them and to assure her that we would all take care that he should make the utmost restitution of everything he had wrongly got this and a few moments’ reflection pacified her but she was not at all disconcerted by what she had done though i cannot say as much for her bonnet and resumed her seat composedly during the last few minutes mrs heep had been clamouring to her son to be ‘umble’ and had been going down on her knees to all of us in succession and making the wildest promises her son sat her down in his chair and standing sulkily by her holding her arm with his hand but not rudely said to me with a ferocious look ‘what do you want done’ ‘i will tell you what must be done’ said traddles ‘has that copperfield no tongue’ muttered uriah ‘i would do a good deal for you if you could tell me without lying that somebody had cut it out’ ‘my uriah means to be umble’ cried his mother ‘do not mind what he says good gentlemen’ ‘what must be done’ said traddles ‘is this first the deed of relinquishment that we have heard of must be given over to me nowhere’ ‘suppose i have not got it’ he interrupted ‘but you have’ said traddles ‘therefore you know we will not suppose so’ and i cannot help avowing that this was the first occasion on which i really did justice to the clear head and the plain patient practical good sense of my old schoolfellow ‘then’ said traddles ‘you must prepare to disgorge all that your rapacity has become possessed of and to make restoration to the last farthing all the partnership books and papers must remain in our possession all your books and papers all money accounts and securities of both kinds in short everything here’ ‘must it i do not know that’ said uriah ‘i must have time to think about that’ ‘certainly’ replied traddles ‘but in the meanwhile and until everything is done to our satisfaction we shall maintain possession of these things and beg youin short compel youto keep to your own room and hold no communication with anyone’ ‘i will not do it’ said uriah with an oath ‘maidstone jail is a safer place of detention’ observed traddles ‘and though the law may be longer in righting us and may not be able to right us so completely as you can there is no doubt of its punishing you dear me you know that quite as well as i copperfield will you go round to the guildhall and bring a couple of officers’ here mrs heep broke out again crying on her knees to agnes to interfere in their behalf exclaiming that he was very humble and it was all true and if he did not do what we wanted she would and much more to the same purpose being half frantic with fears for her darling to inquire what he might have done if he had had any boldness would be like inquiring what a mongrel cur might do if it had the spirit of a tiger he was a coward from head to foot and showed his dastardly nature through his sullenness and mortification as much as at any time of his mean life ‘stop’ he growled to me and wiped his hot face with his hand ‘mother hold your noise well let ‘them have that deed go and fetch it’ ‘do you help her mr dick’ said traddles ‘if you please’ proud of his commission and understanding it mr dick accompanied her as a shepherd’s dog might accompany a sheep but mrs heep gave him little trouble for she not only returned with the deed but with the box in which it was where we found a banker’s book and some other papers that were afterwards serviceable ‘good’ said traddles when this was brought ‘now mr heep you can retire to think particularly observing if you please that i declare to you on the part of all present that there is only one thing to be done that it is what i have explained and that it must be done without delay’ uriah without lifting his eyes from the ground shuffled across the room with his hand to his chin and pausing at the door said ‘copperfield i have always hated you you have always been an upstart and you have always been against me’ ‘as i think i told you once before’ said i ‘it is you who have been in your greed and cunning against all the world it may be profitable to you to reflect in future that there never were greed and cunning in the world yet that did not do too much and overreach themselves it is as certain as death’ ‘or as certain as they used to teach at school the same school where i picked up so much umbleness from nine of the clock to eleven that labour was a curse and from eleven of the clock to one that it was a blessing and a cheerfulness and a dignity and i do not know what all eh’ said he with a sneer ‘you preach about as consistent as they did will not umbleness go down i should not have got round my gentleman fellowpartner without it i think micawber you old bully i will pay you’ mr micawber supremely defiant of him and his extended finger and making a great deal of his chest until he had slunk out at the door then addressed himself to me and proffered me the satisfaction of ‘witnessing the reestablishment of mutual confidence between himself and mrs micawber’ after which he invited the company generally to the contemplation of that affecting spectacle ‘the veil that has long been interposed between mrs micawber and myself is now withdrawn’ said mr micawber ‘and my children and the author of their being can once more come in contact on equal terms’ as we were all very grateful to him and all desirous to show that we were as well as the hurry and disorder of our spirits would permit i dare say we should all have gone but that it was necessary for agnes to return to her father as yet unable to bear more than the dawn of hope and for someone else to hold uriah in safe keeping so traddles remained for the latter purpose to be presently relieved by mr dick and mr dick my aunt and i went home with mr micawber as i parted hurriedly from the dear girl to whom i owed so much and thought from what she had been saved perhaps that morningher better resolution notwithstandingi felt devoutly thankful for the miseries of my younger days which had brought me to the knowledge of mr micawber his house was not far off and as the street door opened into the sittingroom and he bolted in with a precipitation quite his own we found ourselves at once in the bosom of the family mr micawber exclaiming ‘emma my life’ rushed into mrs micawber’s arms mrs micawber shrieked and folded mr micawber in her embrace miss micawber nursing the unconscious stranger of mrs micawber’s last letter to me was sensibly affected the stranger leaped the twins testified their joy by several inconvenient but innocent demonstrations master micawber whose disposition appeared to have been soured by early disappointment and whose aspect had become morose yielded to his better feelings and blubbered ‘emma’ said mr micawber ‘the cloud is past from my mind mutual confidence so long preserved between us once is restored to know no further interruption now welcome poverty’ cried mr micawber shedding tears ‘welcome misery welcome houselessness welcome hunger rags tempest and beggary mutual confidence will sustain us to the end’ with these expressions mr micawber placed mrs micawber in a chair and embraced the family all round welcoming a variety of bleak prospects which appeared to the best of my judgement to be anything but welcome to them and calling upon them to come out into canterbury and sing a chorus as nothing else was left for their support but mrs micawber having in the strength of her emotions fainted away the first thing to be done even before the chorus could be considered complete was to recover her this my aunt and mr micawber did and then my aunt was introduced and mrs micawber recognized me ‘excuse me dear mr copperfield’ said the poor lady giving me her hand ‘but i am not strong and the removal of the late misunderstanding between mr micawber and myself was at first too much for me’ ‘is this all your family madam’ said my aunt ‘there are no more at present’ returned mrs micawber ‘good gracious i did not mean that madam’ said my aunt ‘i mean are all these yours’ ‘madam’ replied mr micawber ‘it is a true bill’ ‘and that eldest young gentleman now’ said my aunt musing ‘what has he been brought up to’ ‘it was my hope when i came here’ said mr micawber ‘to have got wilkins into the church or perhaps i shall express my meaning more strictly if i say the choir but there was no vacancy for a tenor in the venerable pile for which this city is so justly eminent and he hasin short he has contracted a habit of singing in publichouses rather than in sacred edifices’ ‘but he means well’ said mrs micawber tenderly ‘i dare say my love’ rejoined mr micawber ‘that he means particularly well but i have not yet found that he carries out his meaning in any given direction whatsoever’ master micawber’s moroseness of aspect returned upon him again and he demanded with some temper what he was to do whether he had been born a carpenter or a coachpainter any more than he had been born a bird whether he could go into the next street and open a chemist’s shop whether he could rush to the next assizes and proclaim himself a lawyer whether he could come out by force at the opera and succeed by violence whether he could do anything without being brought up to something my aunt mused a little while and then said ‘mr micawber i wonder you have never turned your thoughts to emigration’ ‘madam’ returned mr micawber ‘it was the dream of my youth and the fallacious aspiration of my riper years’ i am thoroughly persuaded by the by that he had never thought of it in his life ‘aye’ said my aunt with a glance at me ‘why what a thing it would be for yourselves and your family mr and mrs micawber if you were to emigrate now’ ‘capital madam capital’ urged mr micawber gloomily ‘that is the principal i may say the only difficulty my dear mr copperfield’ assented his wife ‘capital’ cried my aunt ‘but you are doing us a great servicehave done us a great service i may say for surely much will come out of the fireand what could we do for you that would be half so good as to find the capital’ ‘i could not receive it as a gift’ said mr micawber full of fire and animation ‘but if a sufficient sum could be advanced say at five per cent interest per annum upon my personal liabilitysay my notes of hand at twelve eighteen and twentyfour months respectively to allow time for something to turn up’ ‘could be can be and shall be on your own terms’ returned my aunt ‘if you say the word think of this now both of you here are some people david knows going out to australia shortly if you decide to go why should not you go in the same ship you may help each other think of this now mr and mrs micawber take your time and weigh it well’ ‘there is but one question my dear madam i could wish to ask’ said mrs micawber ‘the climate i believe is healthy’ ‘finest in the world’ said my aunt ‘just so’ returned mrs micawber ‘then my question arises now are the circumstances of the country such that a man of mr micawber’s abilities would have a fair chance of rising in the social scale i will not say at present might he aspire to be governor or anything of that sort but would there be a reasonable opening for his talents to develop themselvesthat would be amply sufficientand find their own expansion’ ‘no better opening anywhere’ said my aunt ‘for a man who conducts himself well and is industrious’ ‘for a man who conducts himself well’ repeated mrs micawber with her clearest business manner ‘and is industrious precisely it is evident to me that australia is the legitimate sphere of action for mr micawber’ ‘i entertain the conviction my dear madam’ said mr micawber ‘that it is under existing circumstances the land the only land for myself and family and that something of an extraordinary nature will turn up on that shore it is no distancecomparatively speaking and though consideration is due to the kindness of your proposal i assure you that is a mere matter of form’ shall i ever forget how in a moment he was the most sanguine of men looking on to fortune or how mrs micawber presently discoursed about the habits of the kangaroo shall i ever recall that street of canterbury on a marketday without recalling him as he walked back with us expressing in the hardy roving manner he assumed the unsettled habits of a temporary sojourner in the land and looking at the bullocks as they came by with the eye of an australian farmer
