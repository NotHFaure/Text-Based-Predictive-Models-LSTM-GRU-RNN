my first dissipation it was a wonderfully fine thing to have that lofty castle to myself and to feel when i shut my outer door like robinson crusoe when he had got into his fortification and pulled his ladder up after him it was a wonderfully fine thing to walk about town with the key of my house in my pocket and to know that i could ask any fellow to come home and make quite sure of its being inconvenient to nobody if it were not so to me it was a wonderfully fine thing to let myself in and out and to come and go without a word to anyone and to ring mrs crupp up gasping from the depths of the earth when i wanted herand when she was disposed to come all this i say was wonderfully fine but i must say too that there were times when it was very dreary it was fine in the morning particularly in the fine mornings it looked a very fresh free life by daylight still fresher and more free by sunlight but as the day declined the life seemed to go down too i do not know how it was it seldom looked well by candlelight i wanted somebody to talk to then i missed agnes i found a tremendous blank in the place of that smiling repository of my confidence mrs crupp appeared to be a long way off i thought about my predecessor who had died of drink and smoke and i could have wished he had been so good as to live and not bother me with his decease after two days and nights i felt as if i had lived there for a year and yet i was not an hour older but was quite as much tormented by my own youthfulness as ever steerforth not yet appearing which induced me to apprehend that he must be ill i left the commons early on the third day and walked out to highgate mrs steerforth was very glad to see me and said that he had gone away with one of his oxford friends to see another who lived near st albans but that she expected him to return tomorrow i was so fond of him that i felt quite jealous of his oxford friends as she pressed me to stay to dinner i remained and i believe we talked about nothing but him all day i told her how much the people liked him at yarmouth and what a delightful companion he had been miss dartle was full of hints and mysterious questions but took a great interest in all our proceedings there and said ‘was it really though’ and so forth so often that she got everything out of me she wanted to know her appearance was exactly what i have described it when i first saw her but the society of the two ladies was so agreeable and came so natural to me that i felt myself falling a little in love with her i could not help thinking several times in the course of the evening and particularly when i walked home at night what delightful company she would be in buckingham street i was taking my coffee and roll in the morning before going to the commonsand i may observe in this place that it is surprising how much coffee mrs crupp used and how weak it was consideringwhen steerforth himself walked in to my unbounded joy ‘my dear steerforth’ cried i ‘i began to think i should never see you again’ ‘i was carried off by force of arms’ said steerforth ‘the very next morning after i got home why daisy what a rare old bachelor you are here’ i showed him over the establishment not omitting the pantry with no little pride and he commended it highly ‘i tell you what old boy’ he added ‘i shall make quite a townhouse of this place unless you give me notice to quit’ this was a delightful hearing i told him if he waited for that he would have to wait till doomsday ‘but you shall have some breakfast’ said i with my hand on the bellrope ‘and mrs crupp shall make you some fresh coffee and i will toast you some bacon in a bachelor’s dutchoven that i have got here’ ‘no no’ said steerforth ‘do not ring i cannot i am going to breakfast with one of these fellows who is at the piazza hotel in covent garden’ ‘but you will come back to dinner’ said i ‘i cannot upon my life there is nothing i should like better but i must remain with these two fellows we are all three off together tomorrow morning’ ‘then bring them here to dinner’ i returned ‘do you think they would come’ ‘oh they would come fast enough’ said steerforth ‘but we should inconvenience you you had better come and dine with us somewhere’ i would not by any means consent to this for it occurred to me that i really ought to have a little housewarming and that there never could be a better opportunity i had a new pride in my rooms after his approval of them and burned with a desire to develop their utmost resources i therefore made him promise positively in the names of his two friends and we appointed six of the clock as the dinnerhour when he was gone i rang for mrs crupp and acquainted her with my desperate design mrs crupp said in the first place of course it was well known she could not be expected to wait but she knew a handy young man who she thought could be prevailed upon to do it and whose terms would be five shillings and what i pleased i said certainly we would have him next mrs crupp said it was clear she could not be in two places at once which i felt to be reasonable and that ‘a young gal’ stationed in the pantry with a bedroom candle there never to desist from washing plates would be indispensable i said what would be the expense of this young female and mrs crupp said she supposed eighteenpence would neither make me nor break me i said i supposed not and that was settled then mrs crupp said now about the dinner it was a remarkable instance of want of forethought on the part of the ironmonger who had made mrs crupp’s kitchen fireplace that it was capable of cooking nothing but chops and mashed potatoes as to a fishkittle mrs crupp said well would i only come and look at the range she could not say fairer than that would i come and look at it as i should not have been much the wiser if i had looked at it i declined and said ‘never mind fish’ but mrs crupp said do not say that oysters was in why not them so that was settled mrs crupp then said what she would recommend would be this a pair of hot roast fowlsfrom the pastrycook’s a dish of stewed beef with vegetablesfrom the pastrycook’s two little corner things as a raised pie and a dish of kidneysfrom the pastrycook’s a tart and if i liked a shape of jellyfrom the pastrycook’s this mrs crupp said would leave her at full liberty to concentrate her mind on the potatoes and to serve up the cheese and celery as she could wish to see it done i acted on mrs crupp’s opinion and gave the order at the pastrycook’s myself walking along the strand afterwards and observing a hard mottled substance in the window of a ham and beef shop which resembled marble but was labelled ‘mock turtle’ i went in and bought a slab of it which i have since seen reason to believe would have sufficed for fifteen people this preparation mrs crupp after some difficulty consented to warm up and it shrunk so much in a liquid state that we found it what steerforth called ‘rather a tight fit’ for four these preparations happily completed i bought a little dessert in covent garden market and gave a rather extensive order at a retail winemerchant’s in that vicinity when i came home in the afternoon and saw the bottles drawn up in a square on the pantry floor they looked so numerous though there were two missing which made mrs crupp very uncomfortable that i was absolutely frightened at them one of steerforth’s friends was named grainger and the other markham they were both very gay and lively fellows grainger something older than steerforth markham youthfullooking and i should say not more than twenty i observed that the latter always spoke of himself indefinitely as ‘a man’ and seldom or never in the first person singular ‘a man might get on very well here mr copperfield’ said markhammeaning himself ‘it is not a bad situation’ said i ‘and the rooms are really commodious’ ‘i hope you have both brought appetites with you’ said steerforth ‘upon my honour’ returned markham ‘town seems to sharpen a man’s appetite a man is hungry all day long a man is perpetually eating’ being a little embarrassed at first and feeling much too young to preside i made steerforth take the head of the table when dinner was announced and seated myself opposite to him everything was very good we did not spare the wine and he exerted himself so brilliantly to make the thing pass off well that there was no pause in our festivity i was not quite such good company during dinner as i could have wished to be for my chair was opposite the door and my attention was distracted by observing that the handy young man went out of the room very often and that his shadow always presented itself immediately afterwards on the wall of the entry with a bottle at its mouth the ‘young gal’ likewise occasioned me some uneasiness not so much by neglecting to wash the plates as by breaking them for being of an inquisitive disposition and unable to confine herself as her positive instructions were to the pantry she was constantly peering in at us and constantly imagining herself detected in which belief she several times retired upon the plates with which she had carefully paved the floor and did a great deal of destruction these however were small drawbacks and easily forgotten when the cloth was cleared and the dessert put on the table at which period of the entertainment the handy young man was discovered to be speechless giving him private directions to seek the society of mrs crupp and to remove the ‘young gal’ to the basement also i abandoned myself to enjoyment i began by being singularly cheerful and lighthearted all sorts of halfforgotten things to talk about came rushing into my mind and made me hold forth in a most unwonted manner i laughed heartily at my own jokes and everybody else’s called steerforth to order for not passing the wine made several engagements to go to oxford announced that i meant to have a dinnerparty exactly like that once a week until further notice and madly took so much snuff out of grainger’s box that i was obliged to go into the pantry and have a private fit of sneezing ten minutes long i went on by passing the wine faster and faster yet and continually starting up with a corkscrew to open more wine long before any was needed i proposed steerforth’s health i said he was my dearest friend the protector of my boyhood and the companion of my prime i said i was delighted to propose his health i said i owed him more obligations than i could ever repay and held him in a higher admiration than i could ever express i finished by saying ‘i will give you steerforth god bless him hurrah’ we gave him three times three and another and a good one to finish with i broke my glass in going round the table to shake hands with him and i said in two words ‘steerforthyou’retheguidingstarofmyexistence’ i went on by finding suddenly that somebody was in the middle of a song markham was the singer and he sang ‘when the heart of a man is depressed with care’ he said when he had sung it he would give us ‘woman’ i took objection to that and i could not allow it i said it was not a respectful way of proposing the toast and i would never permit that toast to be drunk in my house otherwise than as ‘the ladies’ i was very high with him mainly i think because i saw steerforth and grainger laughing at meor at himor at both of us he said a man was not to be dictated to i said a man was he said a man was not to be insulted then i said he was right therenever under my roof where the lares were sacred and the laws of hospitality paramount he said it was no derogation from a man’s dignity to confess that i was a devilish good fellow i instantly proposed his health somebody was smoking we were all smoking i was smoking and trying to suppress a rising tendency to shudder steerforth had made a speech about me in the course of which i had been affected almost to tears i returned thanks and hoped the present company would dine with me tomorrow and the day aftereach day at five of the clock that we might enjoy the pleasures of conversation and society through a long evening i felt called upon to propose an individual i would give them my aunt miss betsey trotwood the best of her sex somebody was leaning out of my bedroom window refreshing his forehead against the cool stone of the parapet and feeling the air upon his face it was myself i was addressing myself as ‘copperfield’ and saying ‘why did you try to smoke you might have known you could not do it’ now somebody was unsteadily contemplating his features in the lookingglass that was i too i was very pale in the lookingglass my eyes had a vacant appearance and my haironly my hair nothing elselooked drunk somebody said to me ‘let us go to the theatre copperfield’ there was no bedroom before me but again the jingling table covered with glasses the lamp grainger on my right hand markham on my left and steerforth oppositeall sitting in a mist and a long way off the theatre to be sure the very thing come along but they must excuse me if i saw everybody out first and turned the lamp offin case of fire owing to some confusion in the dark the door was gone i was feeling for it in the windowcurtains when steerforth laughing took me by the arm and led me out we went downstairs one behind another near the bottom somebody fell and rolled down somebody else said it was copperfield i was angry at that false report until finding myself on my back in the passage i began to think there might be some foundation for it a very foggy night with great rings round the lamps in the streets there was an indistinct talk of its being wet i considered it frosty steerforth dusted me under a lamppost and put my hat into shape which somebody produced from somewhere in a most extraordinary manner for i had not had it on before steerforth then said ‘you are all right copperfield are you not’ and i told him ‘neverberrer’ a man sitting in a pigeonholeplace looked out of the fog and took money from somebody inquiring if i was one of the gentlemen paid for and appearing rather doubtful as i remember in the glimpse i had of him whether to take the money for me or not shortly afterwards we were very high up in a very hot theatre looking down into a large pit that seemed to me to smoke the people with whom it was crammed were so indistinct there was a great stage too looking very clean and smooth after the streets and there were people upon it talking about something or other but not at all intelligibly there was an abundance of bright lights and there was music and there were ladies down in the boxes and i do not know what more the whole building looked to me as if it were learning to swim it conducted itself in such an unaccountable manner when i tried to steady it on somebody is motion we resolved to go downstairs to the dressboxes where the ladies were a gentleman lounging full dressed on a sofa with an operaglass in his hand passed before my view and also my own figure at full length in a glass then i was being ushered into one of these boxes and found myself saying something as i sat down and people about me crying ‘silence’ to somebody and ladies casting indignant glances at me andwhat yesagnes sitting on the seat before me in the same box with a lady and gentleman beside her whom i did not know i see her face now better than i did then i dare say with its indelible look of regret and wonder turned upon me ‘agnes’ i said thickly ‘lorblessmer agnes’ ‘hush pray’ she answered i could not conceive why ‘you disturb the company look at the stage’ i tried on her injunction to fix it and to hear something of what was going on there but quite in vain i looked at her again by and by and saw her shrink into her corner and put her gloved hand to her forehead ‘agnes’ i said ‘i’mafraidyou’renorwell’ ‘yes yes do not mind me trotwood’ she returned ‘listen are you going away soon’ ‘amigoarawaysoo’ i repeated ‘yes’ i had a stupid intention of replying that i was going to wait to hand her downstairs i suppose i expressed it somehow for after she had looked at me attentively for a little while she appeared to understand and replied in a low tone ‘i know you will do as i ask you if i tell you i am very earnest in it go away now trotwood for my sake and ask your friends to take you home’ she had so far improved me for the time that though i was angry with her i felt ashamed and with a short ‘goori’ which i intended for ‘good night’ got up and went away they followed and i stepped at once out of the boxdoor into my bedroom where only steerforth was with me helping me to undress and where i was by turns telling him that agnes was my sister and adjuring him to bring the corkscrew that i might open another bottle of wine how somebody lying in my bed lay saying and doing all this over again at cross purposes in a feverish dream all nightthe bed a rocking sea that was never still how as that somebody slowly settled down into myself did i begin to parch and feel as if my outer covering of skin were a hard board my tongue the bottom of an empty kettle furred with long service and burning up over a slow fire the palms of my hands hot plates of metal which no ice could cool but the agony of mind the remorse and shame i felt when i became conscious next day my horror of having committed a thousand offences i had forgotten and which nothing could ever expiatemy recollection of that indelible look which agnes had given methe torturing impossibility of communicating with her not knowing beast that i was how she came to be in london or where she stayedmy disgust of the very sight of the room where the revel had been heldmy racking headthe smell of smoke the sight of glasses the impossibility of going out or even getting up oh what a day it was oh what an evening when i sat down by my fire to a basin of mutton broth dimpled all over with fat and thought i was going the way of my predecessor and should succeed to his dismal story as well as to his chambers and had half a mind to rush express to dover and reveal all what an evening when mrs crupp coming in to take away the brothbasin produced one kidney on a cheeseplate as the entire remains of yesterday’s feast and i was really inclined to fall upon her nankeen breast and say in heartfelt penitence ‘oh mrs crupp mrs crupp never mind the broken meats i am very miserable’only that i doubted even at that pass if mrs crupp were quite the sort of woman to confide in
