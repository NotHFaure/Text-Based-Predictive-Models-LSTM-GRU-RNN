martha we were now down in westminster we had turned back to follow her having encountered her coming towards us and westminster abbey was the point at which she passed from the lights and noise of the leading streets she proceeded so quickly when she got free of the two currents of passengers setting towards and from the bridge that between this and the advance she had of us when she struck off we were in the narrow waterside street by millbank before we came up with her at that moment she crossed the road as if to avoid the footsteps that she heard so close behind and without looking back passed on even more rapidly a glimpse of the river through a dull gateway where some waggons were housed for the night seemed to arrest my feet i touched my companion without speaking and we both forbore to cross after her and both followed on that opposite side of the way keeping as quietly as we could in the shadow of the houses but keeping very near her there was and is when i write at the end of that lowlying street a dilapidated little wooden building probably an obsolete old ferryhouse its position is just at that point where the street ceases and the road begins to lie between a row of houses and the river as soon as she came here and saw the water she stopped as if she had come to her destination and presently went slowly along by the brink of the river looking intently at it all the way here i had supposed that she was going to some house indeed i had vaguely entertained the hope that the house might be in some way associated with the lost girl but that one dark glimpse of the river through the gateway had instinctively prepared me for her going no farther the neighbourhood was a dreary one at that time as oppressive sad and solitary by night as any about london there were neither wharves nor houses on the melancholy waste of road near the great blank prison a sluggish ditch deposited its mud at the prison walls coarse grass and rank weeds straggled over all the marshy land in the vicinity in one part carcases of houses inauspiciously begun and never finished rotted away in another the ground was cumbered with rusty iron monsters of steamboilers wheels cranks pipes furnaces paddles anchors divingbells windmillsails and i know not what strange objects accumulated by some speculator and grovelling in the dust underneath whichhaving sunk into the soil of their own weight in wet weatherthey had the appearance of vainly trying to hide themselves the clash and glare of sundry fiery works upon the riverside arose by night to disturb everything except the heavy and unbroken smoke that poured out of their chimneys slimy gaps and causeways winding among old wooden piles with a sickly substance clinging to the latter like green hair and the rags of last year’s handbills offering rewards for drowned men fluttering above highwater mark led down through the ooze and slush to the ebbtide there was a story that one of the pits dug for the dead in the time of the great plague was hereabout and a blighting influence seemed to have proceeded from it over the whole place or else it looked as if it had gradually decomposed into that nightmare condition out of the overflowings of the polluted stream as if she were a part of the refuse it had cast out and left to corruption and decay the girl we had followed strayed down to the river’s brink and stood in the midst of this nightpicture lonely and still looking at the water there were some boats and barges astrand in the mud and these enabled us to come within a few yards of her without being seen i then signed to mr peggotty to remain where he was and emerged from their shade to speak to her i did not approach her solitary figure without trembling for this gloomy end to her determined walk and the way in which she stood almost within the cavernous shadow of the iron bridge looking at the lights crookedly reflected in the strong tide inspired a dread within me i think she was talking to herself i am sure although absorbed in gazing at the water that her shawl was off her shoulders and that she was muffling her hands in it in an unsettled and bewildered way more like the action of a sleepwalker than a waking person i know and never can forget that there was that in her wild manner which gave me no assurance but that she would sink before my eyes until i had her arm within my grasp at the same moment i said ‘martha’ she uttered a terrified scream and struggled with me with such strength that i doubt if i could have held her alone but a stronger hand than mine was laid upon her and when she raised her frightened eyes and saw whose it was she made but one more effort and dropped down between us we carried her away from the water to where there were some dry stones and there laid her down crying and moaning in a little while she sat among the stones holding her wretched head with both her hands ‘oh the river’ she cried passionately ‘oh the river’ ‘hush hush’ said i ‘calm yourself’ but she still repeated the same words continually exclaiming ‘oh the river’ over and over again ‘i know it is like me’ she exclaimed ‘i know that i belong to it i know that it is the natural company of such as i am it comes from country places where there was once no harm in itand it creeps through the dismal streets defiled and miserableand it goes away like my life to a great sea that is always troubledand i feel that i must go with it’ i have never known what despair was except in the tone of those words ‘i cannot keep away from it i cannot forget it it haunts me day and night it is the only thing in all the world that i am fit for or that is fit for me oh the dreadful river’ the thought passed through my mind that in the face of my companion as he looked upon her without speech or motion i might have read his niece’s history if i had known nothing of it i never saw in any painting or reality horror and compassion so impressively blended he shook as if he would have fallen and his handi touched it with my own for his appearance alarmed mewas deadly cold ‘she is in a state of frenzy’ i whispered to him ‘she will speak differently in a little time’ i do not know what he would have said in answer he made some motion with his mouth and seemed to think he had spoken but he had only pointed to her with his outstretched hand a new burst of crying came upon her now in which she once more hid her face among the stones and lay before us a prostrate image of humiliation and ruin knowing that this state must pass before we could speak to her with any hope i ventured to restrain him when he would have raised her and we stood by in silence until she became more tranquil ‘martha’ said i then leaning down and helping her to riseshe seemed to want to rise as if with the intention of going away but she was weak and leaned against a boat ‘do you know who this is who is with me’ she said faintly ‘yes’ ‘do you know that we have followed you a long way tonight’ she shook her head she looked neither at him nor at me but stood in a humble attitude holding her bonnet and shawl in one hand without appearing conscious of them and pressing the other clenched against her forehead ‘are you composed enough’ said i ‘to speak on the subject which so interested youi hope heaven may remember itthat snowy night’ her sobs broke out afresh and she murmured some inarticulate thanks to me for not having driven her away from the door ‘i want to say nothing for myself’ she said after a few moments ‘i am bad i am lost i have no hope at all but tell him sir’ she had shrunk away from him ‘if you do not feel too hard to me to do it that i never was in any way the because of his misfortune’ ‘it has never been attributed to you’ i returned earnestly responding to her earnestness ‘it was you if i do not deceive myself’ she said in a broken voice ‘that came into the kitchen the night she took such pity on me was so gentle to me did not shrink away from me like all the rest and gave me such kind help was it you sir’ ‘it was’ said i ‘i should have been in the river long ago’ she said glancing at it with a terrible expression ‘if any wrong to her had been upon my mind i never could have kept out of it a single winter’s night if i had not been free of any share in that’ ‘the because of her flight is too well understood’ i said ‘you are innocent of any part in it we thoroughly believewe know’ ‘oh i might have been much the better for her if i had had a better heart’ exclaimed the girl with most forlorn regret ‘for she was always good to me she never spoke a word to me but what was pleasant and right is it likely i would try to make her what i am myself knowing what i am myself so well when i lost everything that makes life dear the worst of all my thoughts was that i was parted for ever from her’ mr peggotty standing with one hand on the gunwale of the boat and his eyes cast down put his disengaged hand before his face ‘and when i heard what had happened before that snowy night from some belonging to our town’ cried martha ‘the bitterest thought in all my mind was that the people would remember she once kept company with me and would say i had corrupted her when heaven knows i would have died to have brought back her good name’ long unused to any selfcontrol the piercing agony of her remorse and grief was terrible ‘to have died would not have been muchwhat can i sayi would have lived’ she cried ‘i would have lived to be old in the wretched streetsand to wander about avoided in the darkand to see the day break on the ghastly line of houses and remember how the same sun used to shine into my room and wake me oncei would have done even that to save her’ sinking on the stones she took some in each hand and clenched them up as if she would have ground them she writhed into some new posture constantly stiffening her arms twisting them before her face as though to shut out from her eyes the little light there was and drooping her head as if it were heavy with insupportable recollections ‘what shall i ever do’ she said fighting thus with her despair ‘how can i go on as i am a solitary curse to myself a living disgrace to everyone i come near’ suddenly she turned to my companion ‘stamp upon me kill me when she was your pride you would have thought i had done her harm if i had brushed against her in the street you cannot believewhy should youa syllable that comes out of my lips it would be a burning shame upon you even now if she and i exchanged a word i do not complain i do not say she and i are alikei know there is a long long way between us i only say with all my guilt and wretchedness upon my head that i am grateful to her from my soul and love her oh do not think that all the power i had of loving anything is quite worn out throw me away as all the world does kill me for being what i am and having ever known her but do not think that of me’ he looked upon her while she made this supplication in a wild distracted manner and when she was silent gently raised her ‘martha’ said mr peggotty ‘god forbid as i should judge you forbid as i of all men should do that my girl you doen’t know half the change that is come in course of time upon me when you think it likely well’ he paused a moment then went on ‘you doen’t understand how ‘it is that this here gentleman and me has wished to speak to you you doen’t understand what ‘it is we has afore us listen now’ his influence upon her was complete she stood shrinkingly before him as if she were afraid to meet his eyes but her passionate sorrow was quite hushed and mute ‘if you heerd’ said mr peggotty ‘owt of what passed between mas’r davy and me th’ night when it snew so hard you know as i have beenwheer notfur to seek my dear niece my dear niece’ he repeated steadily ‘fur she is more dear to me now martha than she was dear afore’ she put her hands before her face but otherwise remained quiet ‘i have heerd her tell’ said mr peggotty ‘as you was early left fatherless and motherless with no friend fur to take in a rough seafaringway their place maybe you can guess that if you would had such a friend you would have got into a way of being fond of him in course of time and that my niece was kiender daughterlike to me’ as she was silently trembling he put her shawl carefully about her taking it up from the ground for that purpose ‘whereby’ said he ‘i know both as she would go to the wureld’s furdest end with me if she could once see me again and that she would fly to the wureld’s furdest end to keep off seeing me for though she are not no call to doubt my love and doen’tand doen’t’ he repeated with a quiet assurance of the truth of what he said ‘there is shame steps in and keeps betwixt us’ i read in every word of his plain impressive way of delivering himself new evidence of his having thought of this one topic in every feature it presented ‘according to our reckoning’ he proceeded ‘mas’r davy’s here and mine she is like one day to make her own poor solitary course to london we believemas’r davy me and all of usthat you are as innocent of everything that has befell her as the unborn child you have spoke of her being pleasant kind and gentle to you bless her i knew she was i knew she always was to all you are thankful to her and you love her help us all you can to find her and may heaven reward you’ she looked at him hastily and for the first time as if she were doubtful of what he had said ‘will you trust me’ she asked in a low voice of astonishment ‘full and free’ said mr peggotty ‘to speak to her if i should ever find her shelter her if i have any shelter to divide with her and then without her knowledge come to you and bring you to her’ she asked hurriedly we both replied together ‘yes’ she lifted up her eyes and solemnly declared that she would devote herself to this task fervently and faithfully that she would never waver in it never be diverted from it never relinquish it while there was any chance of hope if she were not true to it might the object she now had in life which bound her to something devoid of evil in its passing away from her leave her more forlorn and more despairing if that were possible than she had been upon the river’s brink that night and then might all help human and divine renounce her evermore she did not raise her voice above her breath or address us but said this to the night sky then stood profoundly quiet looking at the gloomy water we judged it expedient now to tell her all we knew which i recounted at length she listened with great attention and with a face that often changed but had the same purpose in all its varying expressions her eyes occasionally filled with tears but those she repressed it seemed as if her spirit were quite altered and she could not be too quiet she asked when all was told where we were to be communicated with if occasion should arise under a dull lamp in the road i wrote our two addresses on a leaf of my pocketbook which i tore out and gave to her and which she put in her poor bosom i asked her where she lived herself she said after a pause in no place long it were better not to know mr peggotty suggesting to me in a whisper what had already occurred to myself i took out my purse but i could not prevail upon her to accept any money nor could i exact any promise from her that she would do so at another time i represented to her that mr peggotty could not be called for one in his condition poor and that the idea of her engaging in this search while depending on her own resources shocked us both she continued steadfast in this particular his influence upon her was equally powerless with mine she gratefully thanked him but remained inexorable ‘there may be work to be got’ she said ‘i will try’ ‘at least take some assistance’ i returned ‘until you have tried’ ‘i could not do what i have promised for money’ she replied ‘i could not take it if i was starving to give me money would be to take away your trust to take away the object that you have given me to take away the only certain thing that saves me from the river’ ‘in the name of the great judge’ said i ‘before whom you and all of us must stand at his dread time dismiss that terrible idea we can all do some good if we will’ she trembled and her lip shook and her face was paler as she answered ‘it has been put into your hearts perhaps to save a wretched creature for repentance i am afraid to think so it seems too bold if any good should come of me i might begin to hope for nothing but harm has ever come of my deeds yet i am to be trusted for the first time in a long while with my miserable life on account of what you have given me to try for i know no more and i can say no more’ again she repressed the tears that had begun to flow and putting out her trembling hand and touching mr peggotty as if there was some healing virtue in him went away along the desolate road she had been ill probably for a long time i observed upon that closer opportunity of observation that she was worn and haggard and that her sunken eyes expressed privation and endurance we followed her at a short distance our way lying in the same direction until we came back into the lighted and populous streets i had such implicit confidence in her declaration that i then put it to mr peggotty whether it would not seem in the onset like distrusting her to follow her any farther he being of the same mind and equally reliant on her we suffered her to take her own road and took ours which was towards highgate he accompanied me a good part of the way and when we parted with a prayer for the success of this fresh effort there was a new and thoughtful compassion in him that i was at no loss to interpret it was midnight when i arrived at home i had reached my own gate and was standing listening for the deep bell of st paul’s the sound of which i thought had been borne towards me among the multitude of striking clocks when i was rather surprised to see that the door of my aunt’s cottage was open and that a faint light in the entry was shining out across the road thinking that my aunt might have relapsed into one of her old alarms and might be watching the progress of some imaginary conflagration in the distance i went to speak to her it was with very great surprise that i saw a man standing in her little garden he had a glass and bottle in his hand and was in the act of drinking i stopped short among the thick foliage outside for the moon was up now though obscured and i recognized the man whom i had once supposed to be a delusion of mr dick’s and had once encountered with my aunt in the streets of the city he was eating as well as drinking and seemed to eat with a hungry appetite he seemed curious regarding the cottage too as if it were the first time he had seen it after stooping to put the bottle on the ground he looked up at the windows and looked about though with a covert and impatient air as if he was anxious to be gone the light in the passage was obscured for a moment and my aunt came out she was agitated and told some money into his hand i heard it chink ‘what is the use of this’ he demanded ‘i can spare no more’ returned my aunt ‘then i cannot go’ said he ‘here you may take it back’ ‘you bad man’ returned my aunt with great emotion ‘how can you use me so but why do i ask it is because you know how weak i am what have i to do to free myself for ever of your visits but to abandon you to your deserts’ ‘and why do not you abandon me to my deserts’ said he ‘you ask me why’ returned my aunt ‘what a heart you must have’ he stood moodily rattling the money and shaking his head until at length he said ‘is this all you mean to give me then’ ‘it is all i can give you’ said my aunt ‘you know i have had losses and am poorer than i used to be i have told you so having got it why do you give me the pain of looking at you for another moment and seeing what you have become’ ‘i have become shabby enough if you mean that’ he said ‘i lead the life of an owl’ ‘you stripped me of the greater part of all i ever had’ said my aunt ‘you closed my heart against the whole world years and years you treated me falsely ungratefully and cruelly go and repent of it do not add new injuries to the long long list of injuries you have done me’ ‘aye’ he returned ‘it is all very finewell i must do the best i can for the present i suppose’ in spite of himself he appeared abashed by my aunt’s indignant tears and came slouching out of the garden taking two or three quick steps as if i had just come up i met him at the gate and went in as he came out we eyed one another narrowly in passing and with no favour ‘aunt’ said i hurriedly ‘this man alarming you again let me speak to him who is he’ ‘child’ returned my aunt taking my arm ‘come in and do not speak to me for ten minutes’ we sat down in her little parlour my aunt retired behind the round green fan of former days which was screwed on the back of a chair and occasionally wiped her eyes for about a quarter of an hour then she came out and took a seat beside me ‘trot’ said my aunt calmly ‘it is my husband’ ‘your husband aunt i thought he had been dead’ ‘dead to me’ returned my aunt ‘but living’ i sat in silent amazement ‘betsey trotwood do not look a likely subject for the tender passion’ said my aunt composedly ‘but the time was trot when she believed in that man most entirely when she loved him trot right well when there was no proof of attachment and affection that she would not have given him he repaid her by breaking her fortune and nearly breaking her heart so she put all that sort of sentiment once and for ever in a grave and filled it up and flattened it down’ ‘my dear good aunt’ ‘i left him’ my aunt proceeded laying her hand as usual on the back of mine ‘generously i may say at this distance of time trot that i left him generously he had been so cruel to me that i might have effected a separation on easy terms for myself but i did not he soon made ducks and drakes of what i gave him sank lower and lower married another woman i believe became an adventurer a gambler and a cheat what he is now you see but he was a finelooking man when i married him’ said my aunt with an echo of her old pride and admiration in her tone ‘and i believed himi was a foolto be the soul of honour’ she gave my hand a squeeze and shook her head ‘he is nothing to me now trotless than nothing but sooner than have him punished for his offences as he would be if he prowled about in this country i give him more money than i can afford at intervals when he reappears to go away i was a fool when i married him and i am so far an incurable fool on that subject that for the sake of what i once believed him to be i would not have even this shadow of my idle fancy hardly dealt with for i was in earnest trot if ever a woman was’ my aunt dismissed the matter with a heavy sigh and smoothed her dress ‘there my dear’ she said ‘now you know the beginning middle and end and all about it we will not mention the subject to one another any more neither of course will you mention it to anybody else this is my grumpy frumpy story and we will keep it to ourselves trot’
