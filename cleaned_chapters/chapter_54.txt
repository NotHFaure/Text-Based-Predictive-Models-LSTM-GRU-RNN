mr micawber’s transactions this is not the time at which i am to enter on the state of my mind beneath its load of sorrow i came to think that the future was walled up before me that the energy and action of my life were at an end that i never could find any refuge but in the grave i came to think so i say but not in the first shock of my grief it slowly grew to that if the events i go on to relate had not thickened around me in the beginning to confuse and in the end to augment my affliction it is possible though i think not probable that i might have fallen at once into this condition as it was an interval occurred before i fully knew my own distress an interval in which i even supposed that its sharpest pangs were past and when my mind could soothe itself by resting on all that was most innocent and beautiful in the tender story that was closed for ever when it was first proposed that i should go abroad or how it came to be agreed among us that i was to seek the restoration of my peace in change and travel i do not even now distinctly know the spirit of agnes so pervaded all we thought and said and did in that time of sorrow that i assume i may refer the project to her influence but her influence was so quiet that i know no more and now indeed i began to think that in my old association of her with the stainedglass window in the church a prophetic foreshadowing of what she would be to me in the calamity that was to happen in the fullness of time had found a way into my mind in all that sorrow from the moment never to be forgotten when she stood before me with her upraised hand she was like a sacred presence in my lonely house when the angel of death alighted there my childwife fell asleepthey told me so when i could bear to hear iton her bosom with a smile from my swoon i first awoke to a consciousness of her compassionate tears her words of hope and peace her gentle face bending down as from a purer region nearer heaven over my undisciplined heart and softening its pain let me go on i was to go abroad that seemed to have been determined among us from the first the ground now covering all that could perish of my departed wife i waited only for what mr micawber called the ‘final pulverization of heep’ and for the departure of the emigrants at the request of traddles most affectionate and devoted of friends in my trouble we returned to canterbury i mean my aunt agnes and i we proceeded by appointment straight to mr micawber’s house where and at mr wickfield’s my friend had been labouring ever since our explosive meeting when poor mrs micawber saw me come in in my black clothes she was sensibly affected there was a great deal of good in mrs micawber’s heart which had not been dunned out of it in all those many years ‘well mr and mrs micawber’ was my aunt’s first salutation after we were seated ‘pray have you thought about that emigration proposal of mine’ ‘my dear madam’ returned mr micawber ‘perhaps i cannot better express the conclusion at which mrs micawber your humble servant and i may add our children have jointly and severally arrived than by borrowing the language of an illustrious poet to reply that our boat is on the shore and our bark is on the sea’ ‘that is right’ said my aunt ‘i augur all sort of good from your sensible decision’ ‘madam you do us a great deal of honour’ he rejoined he then referred to a memorandum ‘with respect to the pecuniary assistance enabling us to launch our frail canoe on the ocean of enterprise i have reconsidered that important businesspoint and would beg to propose my notes of handdrawn it is needless to stipulate on stamps of the amounts respectively required by the various acts of parliament applying to such securitiesat eighteen twentyfour and thirty months the proposition i originally submitted was twelve eighteen and twentyfour but i am apprehensive that such an arrangement might not allow sufficient time for the requisite amount ofsomethingto turn up we might not’ said mr micawber looking round the room as if it represented several hundred acres of highly cultivated land ‘on the first responsibility becoming due have been successful in our harvest or we might not have got our harvest in labour i believe is sometimes difficult to obtain in that portion of our colonial possessions where it will be our lot to combat with the teeming soil’ ‘arrange it in any way you please sir’ said my aunt ‘madam’ he replied ‘mrs micawber and myself are deeply sensible of the very considerate kindness of our friends and patrons what i wish is to be perfectly businesslike and perfectly punctual turning over as we are about to turn over an entirely new leaf and falling back as we are now in the act of falling back for a spring of no common magnitude it is important to my sense of selfrespect besides being an example to my son that these arrangements should be concluded as between man and man’ i do not know that mr micawber attached any meaning to this last phrase i do not know that anybody ever does or did but he appeared to relish it uncommonly and repeated with an impressive cough ‘as between man and man’ ‘i propose’ said mr micawber ‘billsa convenience to the mercantile world for which i believe we are originally indebted to the jews who appear to me to have had a devilish deal too much to do with them ever sincebecause they are negotiable but if a bond or any other description of security would be preferred i should be happy to execute any such instrument as between man and man’ my aunt observed that in a case where both parties were willing to agree to anything she took it for granted there would be no difficulty in settling this point mr micawber was of her opinion ‘in reference to our domestic preparations madam’ said mr micawber with some pride ‘for meeting the destiny to which we are now understood to be selfdevoted i beg to report them my eldest daughter attends at five every morning in a neighbouring establishment to acquire the processif process it may be calledof milking cows my younger children are instructed to observe as closely as circumstances will permit the habits of the pigs and poultry maintained in the poorer parts of this city a pursuit from which they have on two occasions been brought home within an inch of being run over i have myself directed some attention during the past week to the art of baking and my son wilkins has issued forth with a walkingstick and driven cattle when permitted by the rugged hirelings who had them in charge to render any voluntary service in that directionwhich i regret to say for the credit of our nature was not often he being generally warned with imprecations to desist’ ‘all very right indeed’ said my aunt encouragingly ‘mrs micawber has been busy too i have no doubt’ ‘my dear madam’ returned mrs micawber with her businesslike air ‘i am free to confess that i have not been actively engaged in pursuits immediately connected with cultivation or with stock though well aware that both will claim my attention on a foreign shore such opportunities as i have been enabled to alienate from my domestic duties i have devoted to corresponding at some length with my family for i own it seems to me my dear mr copperfield’ said mrs micawber who always fell back on me i suppose from old habit to whomsoever else she might address her discourse at starting ‘that the time is come when the past should be buried in oblivion when my family should take mr micawber by the hand and mr micawber should take my family by the hand when the lion should lie down with the lamb and my family be on terms with mr micawber’ i said i thought so too ‘this at least is the light my dear mr copperfield’ pursued mrs micawber ‘in which i view the subject when i lived at home with my papa and mama my papa was accustomed to ask when any point was under discussion in our limited circle “in what light does my emma view the subject” that my papa was too partial i know still on such a point as the frigid coldness which has ever subsisted between mr micawber and my family i necessarily have formed an opinion delusive though it may be’ ‘no doubt of course you have madam’ said my aunt ‘precisely so’ assented mrs micawber ‘now i may be wrong in my conclusions it is very likely that i am but my individual impression is that the gulf between my family and mr micawber may be traced to an apprehension on the part of my family that mr micawber would require pecuniary accommodation i cannot help thinking’ said mrs micawber with an air of deep sagacity ‘that there are members of my family who have been apprehensive that mr micawber would solicit them for their namesi do not mean to be conferred in baptism upon our children but to be inscribed on bills of exchange and negotiated in the money market’ the look of penetration with which mrs micawber announced this discovery as if no one had ever thought of it before seemed rather to astonish my aunt who abruptly replied ‘well madam upon the whole i should not wonder if you were right’ ‘mr micawber being now on the eve of casting off the pecuniary shackles that have so long enthralled him’ said mrs micawber ‘and of commencing a new career in a country where there is sufficient range for his abilitieswhich in my opinion is exceedingly important mr micawber’s abilities peculiarly requiring spaceit seems to me that my family should signalize the occasion by coming forward what i could wish to see would be a meeting between mr micawber and my family at a festive entertainment to be given at my family’s expense where mr micawber’s health and prosperity being proposed by some leading member of my family mr micawber might have an opportunity of developing his views’ ‘my dear’ said mr micawber with some heat ‘it may be better for me to state distinctly at once that if i were to develop my views to that assembled group they would possibly be found of an offensive nature my impression being that your family are in the aggregate impertinent snobs and in detail unmitigated ruffians’ ‘micawber’ said mrs micawber shaking her head ‘no you have never understood them and they have never understood you’ mr micawber coughed ‘they have never understood you micawber’ said his wife ‘they may be incapable of it if so that is their misfortune i can pity their misfortune’ ‘i am extremely sorry my dear emma’ said mr micawber relenting ‘to have been betrayed into any expressions that might even remotely have the appearance of being strong expressions all i would say is that i can go abroad without your family coming forward to favour mein short with a parting shove of their cold shoulders and that upon the whole i would rather leave england with such impetus as i possess than derive any acceleration of it from that quarter at the same time my dear if they should condescend to reply to your communicationswhich our joint experience renders most improbablefar be it from me to be a barrier to your wishes’ the matter being thus amicably settled mr micawber gave mrs micawber his arm and glancing at the heap of books and papers lying before traddles on the table said they would leave us to ourselves which they ceremoniously did ‘my dear copperfield’ said traddles leaning back in his chair when they were gone and looking at me with an affection that made his eyes red and his hair all kinds of shapes ‘i do not make any excuse for troubling you with business because i know you are deeply interested in it and it may divert your thoughts my dear boy i hope you are not worn out’ ‘i am quite myself’ said i after a pause ‘we have more because to think of my aunt than of anyone you know how much she has done’ ‘surely surely’ answered traddles ‘who can forget it’ ‘but even that is not all’ said i ‘during the last fortnight some new trouble has vexed her and she has been in and out of london every day several times she has gone out early and been absent until evening last night traddles with this journey before her it was almost midnight before she came home you know what her consideration for others is she will not tell me what has happened to distress her’ my aunt very pale and with deep lines in her face sat immovable until i had finished when some stray tears found their way to her cheeks and she put her hand on mine ‘it is nothing trot it is nothing there will be no more of it you shall know by and by now agnes my dear let us attend to these affairs’ ‘i must do mr micawber the justice to say’ traddles began ‘that although he would appear not to have worked to any good account for himself he is a most untiring man when he works for other people i never saw such a fellow if he always goes on in the same way he must be virtually about two hundred years old at present the heat into which he has been continually putting himself and the distracted and impetuous manner in which he has been diving day and night among papers and books to say nothing of the immense number of letters he has written me between this house and mr wickfield’s and often across the table when he has been sitting opposite and might much more easily have spoken is quite extraordinary’ ‘letters’ cried my aunt ‘i believe he dreams in letters’ ‘there is mr dick too’ said traddles ‘has been doing wonders as soon as he was released from overlooking uriah heep whom he kept in such charge as i never saw exceeded he began to devote himself to mr wickfield and really his anxiety to be of use in the investigations we have been making and his real usefulness in extracting and copying and fetching and carrying have been quite stimulating to us’ ‘dick is a very remarkable man’ exclaimed my aunt ‘and i always said he was trot you know it’ ‘i am happy to say miss wickfield’ pursued traddles at once with great delicacy and with great earnestness ‘that in your absence mr wickfield has considerably improved relieved of the incubus that had fastened upon him for so long a time and of the dreadful apprehensions under which he had lived he is hardly the same person at times even his impaired power of concentrating his memory and attention on particular points of business has recovered itself very much and he has been able to assist us in making some things clear that we should have found very difficult indeed if not hopeless without him but what i have to do is to come to results which are short enough not to gossip on all the hopeful circumstances i have observed or i shall never have done’ his natural manner and agreeable simplicity made it transparent that he said this to put us in good heart and to enable agnes to hear her father mentioned with greater confidence but it was not the less pleasant for that ‘now let me see’ said traddles looking among the papers on the table ‘having counted our funds and reduced to order a great mass of unintentional confusion in the first place and of wilful confusion and falsification in the second we take it to be clear that mr wickfield might now wind up his business and his agencytrust and exhibit no deficiency or defalcation whatever’ ‘oh thank heaven’ cried agnes fervently ‘but’ said traddles ‘the surplus that would be left as his means of supportand i suppose the house to be sold even in saying thiswould be so small not exceeding in all probability some hundreds of pounds that perhaps miss wickfield it would be best to consider whether he might not retain his agency of the estate to which he has so long been receiver his friends might advise him you know now he is free you yourself miss wickfieldcopperfieldi’ ‘i have considered it trotwood’ said agnes looking to me ‘and i feel that it ought not to be and must not be even on the recommendation of a friend to whom i am so grateful and owe so much’ ‘i will not say that i recommend it’ observed traddles ‘i think it right to suggest it no more’ ‘i am happy to hear you say so’ answered agnes steadily ‘for it gives me hope almost assurance that we think alike dear mr traddles and dear trotwood papa once free with honour what could i wish for i have always aspired if i could have released him from the toils in which he was held to render back some little portion of the love and care i owe him and to devote my life to him it has been for years the utmost height of my hopes to take our future on myself will be the next great happinessthe next to his release from all trust and responsibilitythat i can know’ ‘have you thought how agnes’ ‘often i am not afraid dear trotwood i am certain of success so many people know me here and think kindly of me that i am certain do not mistrust me our wants are not many if i rent the dear old house and keep a school i shall be useful and happy’ the calm fervour of her cheerful voice brought back so vividly first the dear old house itself and then my solitary home that my heart was too full for speech traddles pretended for a little while to be busily looking among the papers ‘next miss trotwood’ said traddles ‘that property of yours’ ‘well sir’ sighed my aunt ‘all i have got to say about it is that if it is gone i can bear it and if it is not gone i shall be glad to get it back’ ‘it was originally i think eight thousand pounds consols’ said traddles ‘right’ replied my aunt ‘i cannot account for more than five’ said traddles with an air of perplexity ‘thousand do you mean’ inquired my aunt with uncommon composure ‘or pounds’ ‘five thousand pounds’ said traddles ‘it was all there was’ returned my aunt ‘i sold three myself one i paid for your articles trot my dear and the other two i have by me when i lost the rest i thought it wise to say nothing about that sum but to keep it secretly for a rainy day i wanted to see how you would come out of the trial trot and you came out noblypersevering selfreliant selfdenying so did dick do not speak to me for i find my nerves a little shaken’ nobody would have thought so to see her sitting upright with her arms folded but she had wonderful selfcommand ‘then i am delighted to say’ cried traddles beaming with joy ‘that we have recovered the whole money’ ‘do not congratulate me anybody’ exclaimed my aunt ‘how so sir’ ‘you believed it had been misappropriated by mr wickfield’ said traddles ‘of course i did’ said my aunt ‘and was therefore easily silenced agnes not a word’ ‘and indeed’ said traddles ‘it was sold by virtue of the power of management he held from you but i need not say by whom sold or on whose actual signature it was afterwards pretended to mr wickfield by that rascaland proved too by figuresthat he had possessed himself of the money on general instructions he said to keep other deficiencies and difficulties from the light mr wickfield being so weak and helpless in his hands as to pay you afterwards several sums of interest on a pretended principal which he knew did not exist made himself unhappily a party to the fraud’ ‘and at last took the blame upon himself’ added my aunt ‘and wrote me a mad letter charging himself with robbery and wrong unheard of upon which i paid him a visit early one morning called for a candle burnt the letter and told him if he ever could right me and himself to do it and if he could not to keep his own counsel for his daughter’s sakeif anybody speaks to me i will leave the house’ we all remained quiet agnes covering her face ‘well my dear friend’ said my aunt after a pause ‘and you have really extorted the money back from him’ ‘why the fact is’ returned traddles ‘mr micawber had so completely hemmed him in and was always ready with so many new points if an old one failed that he could not escape from us a most remarkable circumstance is that i really do not think he grasped this sum even so much for the gratification of his avarice which was inordinate as in the hatred he felt for copperfield he said so to me plainly he said he would even have spent as much to baulk or injure copperfield’ ‘ha’ said my aunt knitting her brows thoughtfully and glancing at agnes ‘and what is become of him’ ‘i do not know he left here’ said traddles ‘with his mother who had been clamouring and beseeching and disclosing the whole time they went away by one of the london night coaches and i know no more about him except that his malevolence to me at parting was audacious he seemed to consider himself hardly less indebted to me than to mr micawber which i consider as i told him quite a compliment’ ‘do you suppose he has any money traddles’ i asked ‘oh dear yes i should think so’ he replied shaking his head seriously ‘i should say he must have pocketed a good deal in one way or other but i think you would find copperfield if you had an opportunity of observing his course that money would never keep that man out of mischief he is such an incarnate hypocrite that whatever object he pursues he must pursue crookedly it is his only compensation for the outward restraints he puts upon himself always creeping along the ground to some small end or other he will always magnify every object in the way and consequently will hate and suspect everybody that comes in the most innocent manner between him and it so the crooked courses will become crookeder at any moment for the least reason or for none it is only necessary to consider his history here’ said traddles ‘to know that’ ‘he is a monster of meanness’ said my aunt ‘really i do not know about that’ observed traddles thoughtfully ‘many people can be very mean when they give their minds to it’ ‘and now touching mr micawber’ said my aunt ‘well really’ said traddles cheerfully ‘i must once more give mr micawber high praise but for his having been so patient and persevering for so long a time we never could have hoped to do anything worth speaking of and i think we ought to consider that mr micawber did right for right’s sake when we reflect what terms he might have made with uriah heep himself for his silence’ ‘i think so too’ said i ‘now what would you give him’ inquired my aunt ‘oh before you come to that’ said traddles a little disconcerted ‘i am afraid i thought it discreet to omit not being able to carry everything before me two points in making this lawless adjustmentfor it is perfectly lawless from beginning to endof a difficult affair those ioyou’s and so forth which mr micawber gave him for the advances he had’ ‘well they must be paid’ said my aunt ‘yes but i do not know when they may be proceeded on or where they are’ rejoined traddles opening his eyes ‘and i anticipate that between this time and his departure mr micawber will be constantly arrested or taken in execution’ ‘then he must be constantly set free again and taken out of execution’ said my aunt ‘what is the amount altogether’ ‘why mr micawber has entered the transactionshe calls them transactionswith great form in a book’ rejoined traddles smiling ‘and he makes the amount a hundred and three pounds five’ ‘now what shall we give him that sum included’ said my aunt ‘agnes my dear you and i can talk about division of it afterwards what should it be five hundred pounds’ upon this traddles and i both struck in at once we both recommended a small sum in money and the payment without stipulation to mr micawber of the uriah claims as they came in we proposed that the family should have their passage and their outfit and a hundred pounds and that mr micawber’s arrangement for the repayment of the advances should be gravely entered into as it might be wholesome for him to suppose himself under that responsibility to this i added the suggestion that i should give some explanation of his character and history to mr peggotty who i knew could be relied on and that to mr peggotty should be quietly entrusted the discretion of advancing another hundred i further proposed to interest mr micawber in mr peggotty by confiding so much of mr peggotty’s story to him as i might feel justified in relating or might think expedient and to endeavour to bring each of them to bear upon the other for the common advantage we all entered warmly into these views and i may mention at once that the principals themselves did so shortly afterwards with perfect good will and harmony seeing that traddles now glanced anxiously at my aunt again i reminded him of the second and last point to which he had adverted ‘you and your aunt will excuse me copperfield if i touch upon a painful theme as i greatly fear i shall’ said traddles hesitating ‘but i think it necessary to bring it to your recollection on the day of mr micawber’s memorable denunciation a threatening allusion was made by uriah heep to your aunt’shusband’ my aunt retaining her stiff position and apparent composure assented with a nod ‘perhaps’ observed traddles ‘it was mere purposeless impertinence’ ‘no’ returned my aunt ‘there waspardon mereally such a person and at all in his power’ hinted traddles ‘yes my good friend’ said my aunt traddles with a perceptible lengthening of his face explained that he had not been able to approach this subject that it had shared the fate of mr micawber’s liabilities in not being comprehended in the terms he had made that we were no longer of any authority with uriah heep and that if he could do us or any of us any injury or annoyance no doubt he would my aunt remained quiet until again some stray tears found their way to her cheeks ‘you are quite right’ she said ‘it was very thoughtful to mention it’ ‘can ior copperfielddo anything’ asked traddles gently ‘nothing’ said my aunt ‘i thank you many times trot my dear a vain threat let us have mr and mrs micawber back and do not any of you speak to me’ with that she smoothed her dress and sat with her upright carriage looking at the door ‘well mr and mrs micawber’ said my aunt when they entered ‘we have been discussing your emigration with many apologies to you for keeping you out of the room so long and i will tell you what arrangements we propose’ these she explained to the unbounded satisfaction of the familychildren and all being then presentand so much to the awakening of mr micawber’s punctual habits in the opening stage of all bill transactions that he could not be dissuaded from immediately rushing out in the highest spirits to buy the stamps for his notes of hand but his joy received a sudden check for within five minutes he returned in the custody of a sheriff’s officer informing us in a flood of tears that all was lost we being quite prepared for this event which was of course a proceeding of uriah heep’s soon paid the money and in five minutes more mr micawber was seated at the table filling up the stamps with an expression of perfect joy which only that congenial employment or the making of punch could impart in full completeness to his shining face to see him at work on the stamps with the relish of an artist touching them like pictures looking at them sideways taking weighty notes of dates and amounts in his pocketbook and contemplating them when finished with a high sense of their precious value was a sight indeed ‘now the best thing you can do sir if you will allow me to advise you’ said my aunt after silently observing him ‘is to abjure that occupation for evermore’ ‘madam’ replied mr micawber ‘it is my intention to register such a vow on the virgin page of the future mrs micawber will attest it i trust’ said mr micawber solemnly ‘that my son wilkins will ever bear in mind that he had infinitely better put his fist in the fire than use it to handle the serpents that have poisoned the lifeblood of his unhappy parent’ deeply affected and changed in a moment to the image of despair mr micawber regarded the serpents with a look of gloomy abhorrence in which his late admiration of them was not quite subdued folded them up and put them in his pocket this closed the proceedings of the evening we were weary with sorrow and fatigue and my aunt and i were to return to london on the morrow it was arranged that the micawbers should follow us after effecting a sale of their goods to a broker that mr wickfield’s affairs should be brought to a settlement with all convenient speed under the direction of traddles and that agnes should also come to london pending those arrangements we passed the night at the old house which freed from the presence of the heeps seemed purged of a disease and i lay in my old room like a shipwrecked wanderer come home we went back next day to my aunt’s housenot to mineand when she and i sat alone as of old before going to bed she said ‘trot do you really wish to know what i have had upon my mind lately’ ‘indeed i do aunt if there ever was a time when i felt unwilling that you should have a sorrow or anxiety which i could not share it is now’ ‘you have had sorrow enough child’ said my aunt affectionately ‘without the addition of my little miseries i could have no other motive trot in keeping anything from you’ ‘i know that well’ said i ‘but tell me now’ ‘would you ride with me a little way tomorrow morning’ asked my aunt ‘of course’ ‘at nine’ said she ‘i will tell you then my dear’ at nine accordingly we went out in a little chariot and drove to london we drove a long way through the streets until we came to one of the large hospitals standing hard by the building was a plain hearse the driver recognized my aunt and in obedience to a motion of her hand at the window drove slowly off we following ‘you understand it now trot’ said my aunt ‘he is gone’ ‘did he die in the hospital’ ‘yes’ she sat immovable beside me but again i saw the stray tears on her face ‘he was there once before’ said my aunt presently ‘he was ailing a long timea shattered broken man these many years when he knew his state in this last illness he asked them to send for me he was sorry then very sorry’ ‘you went i know aunt’ ‘i went i was with him a good deal afterwards’ ‘he died the night before we went to canterbury’ said i my aunt nodded ‘no one can harm him now’ she said ‘it was a vain threat’ we drove away out of town to the churchyard at hornsey ‘better here than in the streets’ said my aunt ‘he was born here’ we alighted and followed the plain coffin to a corner i remember well where the service was read consigning it to the dust ‘sixandthirty years ago this day my dear’ said my aunt as we walked back to the chariot ‘i was married god forgive us all’ we took our seats in silence and so she sat beside me for a long time holding my hand at length she suddenly burst into tears and said ‘he was a finelooking man when i married him trotand he was sadly changed’ it did not last long after the relief of tears she soon became composed and even cheerful her nerves were a little shaken she said or she would not have given way to it god forgive us all so we rode back to her little cottage at highgate where we found the following short note which had arrived by that morning’s post from mr micawber ‘canterbury ‘friday ‘my dear madam and copperfield ‘the fair land of promise lately looming on the horizon is again enveloped in impenetrable mists and for ever withdrawn from the eyes of a drifting wretch whose doom is sealed ‘another writ has been issued in his majesty’s high court of king’s bench at westminster in another because of heep v micawber and the defendant in that because is the prey of the sheriff having legal jurisdiction in this bailiwick ‘now’s the day and now’s the hour see the front of battle lower see approach proud edward’s power chains and slavery ‘consigned to which and to a speedy end for mental torture is not supportable beyond a certain point and that point i feel i have attained my course is run bless you bless you some future traveller visiting from motives of curiosity not unmingled let us hope with sympathy the place of confinement allotted to debtors in this city may and i trust will ponder as he traces on its wall inscribed with a rusty nail ‘the obscure initials ‘w m ‘ps i reopen this to say that our common friend mr thomas traddles who has not yet left us and is looking extremely well has paid the debt and costs in the noble name of miss trotwood and that myself and family are at the height of earthly bliss’
