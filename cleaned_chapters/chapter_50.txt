mr peggotty’s dream comes true by this time some months had passed since our interview on the bank of the river with martha i had never seen her since but she had communicated with mr peggotty on several occasions nothing had come of her zealous intervention nor could i infer from what he told me that any clue had been obtained for a moment to emily’s fate i confess that i began to despair of her recovery and gradually to sink deeper and deeper into the belief that she was dead his conviction remained unchanged so far as i knowand i believe his honest heart was transparent to mehe never wavered again in his solemn certainty of finding her his patience never tired and although i trembled for the agony it might one day be to him to have his strong assurance shivered at a blow there was something so religious in it so affectingly expressive of its anchor being in the purest depths of his fine nature that the respect and honour in which i held him were exalted every day his was not a lazy trustfulness that hoped and did no more he had been a man of sturdy action all his life and he knew that in all things wherein he wanted help he must do his own part faithfully and help himself i have known him set out in the night on a misgiving that the light might not be by some accident in the window of the old boat and walk to yarmouth i have known him on reading something in the newspaper that might apply to her take up his stick and go forth on a journey of threeor fourscore miles he made his way by sea to naples and back after hearing the narrative to which miss dartle had assisted me all his journeys were ruggedly performed for he was always steadfast in a purpose of saving money for emily’s sake when she should be found in all this long pursuit i never heard him repine i never heard him say he was fatigued or out of heart dora had often seen him since our marriage and was quite fond of him i fancy his figure before me now standing near her sofa with his rough cap in his hand and the blue eyes of my childwife raised with a timid wonder to his face sometimes of an evening about twilight when he came to talk with me i would induce him to smoke his pipe in the garden as we slowly paced to and fro together and then the picture of his deserted home and the comfortable air it used to have in my childish eyes of an evening when the fire was burning and the wind moaning round it came most vividly into my mind one evening at this hour he told me that he had found martha waiting near his lodging on the preceding night when he came out and that she had asked him not to leave london on any account until he should have seen her again ‘did she tell you why’ i inquired ‘i asked her mas’r davy’ he replied ‘but it is but few words as she ever says and she on’y got my promise and so went away’ ‘did she say when you might expect to see her again’ i demanded ‘no mas’r davy’ he returned drawing his hand thoughtfully down his face ‘i asked that too but it was more she said than she could tell’ as i had long forborne to encourage him with hopes that hung on threads i made no other comment on this information than that i supposed he would see her soon such speculations as it engendered within me i kept to myself and those were faint enough i was walking alone in the garden one evening about a fortnight afterwards i remember that evening well it was the second in mr micawber’s week of suspense there had been rain all day and there was a damp feeling in the air the leaves were thick upon the trees and heavy with wet but the rain had ceased though the sky was still dark and the hopeful birds were singing cheerfully as i walked to and fro in the garden and the twilight began to close around me their little voices were hushed and that peculiar silence which belongs to such an evening in the country when the lightest trees are quite still save for the occasional droppings from their boughs prevailed there was a little green perspective of trelliswork and ivy at the side of our cottage through which i could see from the garden where i was walking into the road before the house i happened to turn my eyes towards this place as i was thinking of many things and i saw a figure beyond dressed in a plain cloak it was bending eagerly towards me and beckoning ‘martha’ said i going to it ‘can you come with me’ she inquired in an agitated whisper ‘i have been to him and he is not at home i wrote down where he was to come and left it on his table with my own hand they said he would not be out long i have tidings for him can you come directly’ my answer was to pass out at the gate immediately she made a hasty gesture with her hand as if to entreat my patience and my silence and turned towards london whence as her dress betokened she had come expeditiously on foot i asked her if that were not our destination on her motioning yes with the same hasty gesture as before i stopped an empty coach that was coming by and we got into it when i asked her where the coachman was to drive she answered ‘anywhere near golden square and quick’then shrunk into a corner with one trembling hand before her face and the other making the former gesture as if she could not bear a voice now much disturbed and dazzled with conflicting gleams of hope and dread i looked at her for some explanation but seeing how strongly she desired to remain quiet and feeling that it was my own natural inclination too at such a time i did not attempt to break the silence we proceeded without a word being spoken sometimes she glanced out of the window as though she thought we were going slowly though indeed we were going fast but otherwise remained exactly as at first we alighted at one of the entrances to the square she had mentioned where i directed the coach to wait not knowing but that we might have some occasion for it she laid her hand on my arm and hurried me on to one of the sombre streets of which there are several in that part where the houses were once fair dwellings in the occupation of single families but have and had long degenerated into poor lodgings let off in rooms entering at the open door of one of these and releasing my arm she beckoned me to follow her up the common staircase which was like a tributary channel to the street the house swarmed with inmates as we went up doors of rooms were opened and people’s heads put out and we passed other people on the stairs who were coming down in glancing up from the outside before we entered i had seen women and children lolling at the windows over flowerpots and we seemed to have attracted their curiosity for these were principally the observers who looked out of their doors it was a broad panelled staircase with massive balustrades of some dark wood cornices above the doors ornamented with carved fruit and flowers and broad seats in the windows but all these tokens of past grandeur were miserably decayed and dirty rot damp and age had weakened the flooring which in many places was unsound and even unsafe some attempts had been made i noticed to infuse new blood into this dwindling frame by repairing the costly old woodwork here and there with common deal but it was like the marriage of a reduced old noble to a plebeian pauper and each party to the illassorted union shrunk away from the other several of the back windows on the staircase had been darkened or wholly blocked up in those that remained there was scarcely any glass and through the crumbling frames by which the bad air seemed always to come in and never to go out i saw through other glassless windows into other houses in a similar condition and looked giddily down into a wretched yard which was the common dustheap of the mansion we proceeded to the topstorey of the house two or three times by the way i thought i observed in the indistinct light the skirts of a female figure going up before us as we turned to ascend the last flight of stairs between us and the roof we caught a full view of this figure pausing for a moment at a door then it turned the handle and went in ‘what is this’ said martha in a whisper ‘she has gone into my room i do not know her’ i knew her i had recognized her with amazement for miss dartle i said something to the effect that it was a lady whom i had seen before in a few words to my conductress and had scarcely done so when we heard her voice in the room though not from where we stood what she was saying martha with an astonished look repeated her former action and softly led me up the stairs and then by a little backdoor which seemed to have no lock and which she pushed open with a touch into a small empty garret with a low sloping roof little better than a cupboard between this and the room she had called hers there was a small door of communication standing partly open here we stopped breathless with our ascent and she placed her hand lightly on my lips i could only see of the room beyond that it was pretty large that there was a bed in it and that there were some common pictures of ships upon the walls i could not see miss dartle or the person whom we had heard her address certainly my companion could not for my position was the best a dead silence prevailed for some moments martha kept one hand on my lips and raised the other in a listening attitude ‘it matters little to me her not being at home’ said rosa dartle haughtily ‘i know nothing of her it is you i come to see’ ‘me’ replied a soft voice at the sound of it a thrill went through my frame for it was emily’s ‘yes’ returned miss dartle ‘i have come to look at you what you are not ashamed of the face that has done so much’ the resolute and unrelenting hatred of her tone its cold stern sharpness and its mastered rage presented her before me as if i had seen her standing in the light i saw the flashing black eyes and the passionwasted figure and i saw the scar with its white track cutting through her lips quivering and throbbing as she spoke ‘i have come to see’ she said ‘james steerforth’s fancy the girl who ran away with him and is the towntalk of the commonest people of her native place the bold flaunting practised companion of persons like james steerforth i want to know what such a thing is like’ there was a rustle as if the unhappy girl on whom she heaped these taunts ran towards the door and the speaker swiftly interposed herself before it it was succeeded by a moment’s pause when miss dartle spoke again it was through her set teeth and with a stamp upon the ground ‘stay there’ she said ‘or i will proclaim you to the house and the whole street if you try to evade me i will stop you if it is by the hair and raise the very stones against you’ a frightened murmur was the only reply that reached my ears a silence succeeded i did not know what to do much as i desired to put an end to the interview i felt that i had no right to present myself that it was for mr peggotty alone to see her and recover her would he never come i thought impatiently ‘so’ said rosa dartle with a contemptuous laugh ‘i see her at last why he was a poor creature to be taken by that delicate mockmodesty and that hanging head’ ‘oh for heaven’s sake spare me’ exclaimed emily ‘whoever you are you know my pitiable story and for heaven’s sake spare me if you would be spared yourself’ ‘if i would be spared’ returned the other fiercely ‘what is there in common between us do you think’ ‘nothing but our sex’ said emily with a burst of tears ‘and that’ said rosa dartle ‘is so strong a claim preferred by one so infamous that if i had any feeling in my breast but scorn and abhorrence of you it would freeze it up our sex you are an honour to our sex’ ‘i have deserved this’ said emily ‘but it is dreadful dear dear lady think what i have suffered and how i am fallen oh martha come back oh home home’ miss dartle placed herself in a chair within view of the door and looked downward as if emily were crouching on the floor before her being now between me and the light i could see her curled lip and her cruel eyes intently fixed on one place with a greedy triumph ‘listen to what i say’ she said ‘and reserve your false arts for your dupes do you hope to move me by your tears no more than you could charm me by your smiles you purchased slave’ ‘oh have some mercy on me’ cried emily ‘show me some compassion or i shall die mad’ ‘it would be no great penance’ said rosa dartle ‘for your crimes do you know what you have done do you ever think of the home you have laid waste’ ‘oh is there ever night or day when i do not think of it’ cried emily and now i could just see her on her knees with her head thrown back her pale face looking upward her hands wildly clasped and held out and her hair streaming about her ‘has there ever been a single minute waking or sleeping when it has not been before me just as it used to be in the lost days when i turned my back upon it for ever and for ever oh home home oh dear dear uncle if you ever could have known the agony your love would cause me when i fell away from good you never would have shown it to me so constant much as you felt it but would have been angry to me at least once in my life that i might have had some comfort i have none none no comfort upon earth for all of them were always fond of me’ she dropped on her face before the imperious figure in the chair with an imploring effort to clasp the skirt of her dress rosa dartle sat looking down upon her as inflexible as a figure of brass her lips were tightly compressed as if she knew that she must keep a strong constraint upon herselfi write what i sincerely believeor she would be tempted to strike the beautiful form with her foot i saw her distinctly and the whole power of her face and character seemed forced into that expressionwould he never come ‘the miserable vanity of these earthworms’ she said when she had so far controlled the angry heavings of her breast that she could trust herself to speak ‘your home do you imagine that i bestow a thought on it or suppose you could do any harm to that low place which money would not pay for and handsomely your home you were a part of the trade of your home and were bought and sold like any other vendible thing your people dealt in’ ‘oh not that’ cried emily ‘say anything of me but do not visit my disgrace and shame more than i have done on folks who are as honourable as you have some respect for them as you are a lady if you have no mercy for me’ ‘i speak’ she said not deigning to take any heed of this appeal and drawing away her dress from the contamination of emily’s touch ‘i speak of his homewhere i live here’ she said stretching out her hand with her contemptuous laugh and looking down upon the prostrate girl ‘is a worthy because of division between ladymother and gentlemanson of grief in a house where she would not have been admitted as a kitchengirl of anger and repining and reproach this piece of pollution picked up from the waterside to be made much of for an hour and then tossed back to her original place’ ‘no no’ cried emily clasping her hands together ‘when he first came into my waythat the day had never dawned upon me and he had met me being carried to my gravei had been brought up as virtuous as you or any lady and was going to be the wife of as good a man as you or any lady in the world can ever marry if you live in his home and know him you know perhaps what his power with a weak vain girl might be i do not defend myself but i know well and he knows well or he will know when he comes to die and his mind is troubled with it that he used all his power to deceive me and that i believed him trusted him and loved him’ rosa dartle sprang up from her seat recoiled and in recoiling struck at her with a face of such malignity so darkened and disfigured by passion that i had almost thrown myself between them the blow which had no aim fell upon the air as she now stood panting looking at her with the utmost detestation that she was capable of expressing and trembling from head to foot with rage and scorn i thought i had never seen such a sight and never could see such another ‘you love him you’ she cried with her clenched hand quivering as if it only wanted a weapon to stab the object of her wrath emily had shrunk out of my view there was no reply ‘and tell that to me’ she added ‘with your shameful lips why do not they whip these creatures if i could order it to be done i would have this girl whipped to death’ and so she would i have no doubt i would not have trusted her with the rack itself while that furious look lasted she slowly very slowly broke into a laugh and pointed at emily with her hand as if she were a sight of shame for gods and men ‘she love’ she said ‘that carrion and he ever cared for her she would tell me ha ha the liars that these traders are’ her mockery was worse than her undisguised rage of the two i would have much preferred to be the object of the latter but when she suffered it to break loose it was only for a moment she had chained it up again and however it might tear her within she subdued it to herself ‘i came here you pure fountain of love’ she said ‘to seeas i began by telling youwhat such a thing as you was like i was curious i am satisfied also to tell you that you had best seek that home of yours with all speed and hide your head among those excellent people who are expecting you and whom your money will console when it is all gone you can believe and trust and love again you know i thought you a broken toy that had lasted its time a worthless spangle that was tarnished and thrown away but finding you true gold a very lady and an illused innocent with a fresh heart full of love and trustfulnesswhich you look like and is quite consistent with your storyi have something more to say attend to it for what i say i will do do you hear me you fairy spirit what i say i mean to do’ her rage got the better of her again for a moment but it passed over her face like a spasm and left her smiling ‘hide yourself’ she pursued ‘if not at home somewhere let it be somewhere beyond reach in some obscure lifeor better still in some obscure death i wonder if your loving heart will not break you have found no way of helping it to be still i have heard of such means sometimes i believe they may be easily found’ a low crying on the part of emily interrupted her here she stopped and listened to it as if it were music ‘i am of a strange nature perhaps’ rosa dartle went on ‘but i cannot breathe freely in the air you breathe i find it sickly therefore i will have it cleared i will have it purified of you if you live here tomorrow i will have your story and your character proclaimed on the common stair there are decent women in the house i am told and it is a pity such a light as you should be among them and concealed if leaving here you seek any refuge in this town in any character but your true one which you are welcome to bear without molestation from me the same service shall be done you if i hear of your retreat being assisted by a gentleman who not long ago aspired to the favour of your hand i am sanguine as to that’ would he never never come how long was i to bear this how long could i bear it ‘oh me oh me’ exclaimed the wretched emily in a tone that might have touched the hardest heart i should have thought but there was no relenting in rosa dartle’s smile ‘what what shall i do’ ‘do’ returned the other ‘live happy in your own reflections consecrate your existence to the recollection of james steerforth’s tendernesshe would have made you his servingman’s wife would he notor to feeling grateful to the upright and deserving creature who would have taken you as his gift or if those proud remembrances and the consciousness of your own virtues and the honourable position to which they have raised you in the eyes of everything that wears the human shape will not sustain you marry that good man and be happy in his condescension if this will not do either die there are doorways and dustheaps for such deaths and such despairfind one and take your flight to heaven’ i heard a distant foot upon the stairs i knew it i was certain it was his thank god she moved slowly from before the door when she said this and passed out of my sight ‘but mark’ she added slowly and sternly opening the other door to go away ‘i am resolved for reasons that i have and hatreds that i entertain to cast you out unless you withdraw from my reach altogether or drop your pretty mask this is what i had to say and what i say i mean to do’ the foot upon the stairs came nearernearerpassed her as she went downrushed into the room ‘uncle’ a fearful cry followed the word i paused a moment and looking in saw him supporting her insensible figure in his arms he gazed for a few seconds in the face then stooped to kiss itoh how tenderlyand drew a handkerchief before it ‘mas’r davy’ he said in a low tremulous voice when it was covered ‘i thank my heav’nly father as my dream’s come true i thank him hearty for having guided of me in his own ways to my darling’ with those words he took her up in his arms and with the veiled face lying on his bosom and addressed towards his own carried her motionless and unconscious down the stairs
