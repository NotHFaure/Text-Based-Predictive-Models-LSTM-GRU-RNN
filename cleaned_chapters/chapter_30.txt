a loss i got down to yarmouth in the evening and went to the inn i knew that peggotty’s spare roommy roomwas likely to have occupation enough in a little while if that great visitor before whose presence all the living must give place were not already in the house so i betook myself to the inn and dined there and engaged my bed it was ten of the clock when i went out many of the shops were shut and the town was dull when i came to omer and joram’s i found the shutters up but the shop door standing open as i could obtain a perspective view of mr omer inside smoking his pipe by the parlour door i entered and asked him how he was ‘why bless my life and soul’ said mr omer ‘how do you find yourself take a seatsmoke not disagreeable i hope’ ‘by no means’ said i ‘i like itin somebody else’s pipe’ ‘what not in your own eh’ mr omer returned laughing ‘all the better sir bad habit for a young man take a seat i smoke myself for the asthma’ mr omer had made room for me and placed a chair he now sat down again very much out of breath gasping at his pipe as if it contained a supply of that necessary without which he must perish ‘i am sorry to have heard bad news of mr barkis’ said i mr omer looked at me with a steady countenance and shook his head ‘do you know how he is tonight’ i asked ‘the very question i should have put to you sir’ returned mr omer ‘but on account of delicacy it is one of the drawbacks of our line of business when a party’s ill we cannot ask how the party is’ the difficulty had not occurred to me though i had had my apprehensions too when i went in of hearing the old tune on its being mentioned i recognized it however and said as much ‘yes yes you understand’ said mr omer nodding his head ‘we dursn’t do it bless you it would be a shock that the generality of parties might not recover to say “omer and joram’s compliments and how do you find yourself this morning”or this afternoonas it may be’ mr omer and i nodded at each other and mr omer recruited his wind by the aid of his pipe ‘it is one of the things that cut the trade off from attentions they could often wish to show’ said mr omer ‘take myself if i have known barkis a year to move to as he went by i have known him forty years but i cannot go and say “how is he”’ i felt it was rather hard on mr omer and i told him so ‘i am not more selfinterested i hope than another man’ said mr omer ‘look at me my wind may fail me at any moment and it are not likely that to my own knowledge i would be selfinterested under such circumstances i say it are not likely in a man who knows his wind will go when it does go as if a pair of bellows was cut open and that man a grandfather’ said mr omer i said ‘not at all’ ‘it are not that i complain of my line of business’ said mr omer ‘it are not that some good and some bad goes no doubt to all callings what i wish is that parties was brought up strongerminded’ mr omer with a very complacent and amiable face took several puffs in silence and then said resuming his first point ‘accordingly we are obleeged in ascertaining how barkis goes on to limit ourselves to them’ly she knows what our real objects are and she do not have any more alarms or suspicions about us than if we was so many lambs minnie and joram have just stepped down to the house in fact she is there after hours helping her aunt a bit to ask her how he is tonight and if you was to please to wait till they come back they would give you full partic’lers will you take something a glass of srub and water now i smoke on srub and water myself’ said mr omer taking up his glass ‘because it is considered softening to the passages by which this troublesome breath of mine gets into action but lord bless you’ said mr omer huskily ‘it are not the passages that is out of order “give me breath enough” said i to my daughter minnie “and i will find passages my dear”’ he really had no breath to spare and it was very alarming to see him laugh when he was again in a condition to be talked to i thanked him for the proffered refreshment which i declined as i had just had dinner and observing that i would wait since he was so good as to invite me until his daughter and his soninlaw came back i inquired how little emily was ‘well sir’ said mr omer removing his pipe that he might rub his chin ‘i tell you truly i shall be glad when her marriage has taken place’ ‘why so’ i inquired ‘well she is unsettled at present’ said mr omer ‘it are not that she is not as pretty as ever for she is prettieri do assure you she is prettier it are not that she do not work as well as ever for she does she was worth any six and she is worth any six but somehow she wants heart if you understand’ said mr omer after rubbing his chin again and smoking a little ‘what i mean in a general way by the expression “a long pull and a strong pull and a pull altogether my hearties hurrah” i should say to you that that wasin a general waywhat i miss in them’ly’ mr omer’s face and manner went for so much that i could conscientiously nod my head as divining his meaning my quickness of apprehension seemed to please him and he went on ‘now i consider this is principally on account of her being in an unsettled state you see we have talked it over a good deal her uncle and myself and her sweetheart and myself after business and i consider it is principally on account of her being unsettled you must always recollect of them’ly’ said mr omer shaking his head gently ‘that she is a most extraordinary affectionate little thing the proverb says “you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear” well i do not know about that i rather think you may if you begin early in life she has made a home out of that old boat sir that stone and marble could not beat’ ‘i am sure she has’ said i ‘to see the clinging of that pretty little thing to her uncle’ said mr omer ‘to see the way she holds on to him tighter and tighter and closer and closer every day is to see a sight now you know there is a struggle going on when that is the case why should it be made a longer one than is needful’ i listened attentively to the good old fellow and acquiesced with all my heart in what he said ‘therefore i mentioned to them’ said mr omer in a comfortable easygoing tone ‘this i said “now do not consider them’ly nailed down in point of time at all make it your own time her services have been more valuable than was supposed her learning has been quicker than was supposed omer and joram can run their pen through what remains and she is free when you wish if she likes to make any little arrangement afterwards in the way of doing any little thing for us at home very well if she do not very well still we are no losers anyhow” fordo not you see’ said mr omer touching me with his pipe ‘it are not likely that a man so short of breath as myself and a grandfather too would go and strain points with a little bit of a blueeyed blossom like her’ ‘not at all i am certain’ said i ‘not at all you are right’ said mr omer ‘well sir her cousinyou know it is a cousin she is going to be married to’ ‘oh yes’ i replied ‘i know him well’ ‘of course you do’ said mr omer ‘well sir her cousin being as it appears in good work and well to do thanked me in a very manly sort of manner for this conducting himself altogether i must say in a way that gives me a high opinion of him and went and took as comfortable a little house as you or i could wish to clap eyes on that little house is now furnished right through as neat and complete as a doll’s parlour and but for barkis’s illness having taken this bad turn poor fellow they would have been man and wifei dare say by this time as it is there is a postponement’ ‘and emily mr omer’ i inquired ‘has she become more settled’ ‘why that you know’ he returned rubbing his double chin again ‘cannot naturally be expected the prospect of the change and separation and all that is as one may say close to her and far away from her both at once barkis’s death need not put it off much but his lingering might anyway it is an uncertain state of matters you see’ ‘i see’ said i ‘consequently’ pursued mr omer ‘them’ly’s still a little down and a little fluttered perhaps upon the whole she is more so than she was every day she seems to get fonder and fonder of her uncle and more loth to part from all of us a kind word from me brings the tears into her eyes and if you was to see her with my daughter minnie’s little girl you would never forget it bless my heart alive’ said mr omer pondering ‘how she loves that child’ having so favourable an opportunity it occurred to me to ask mr omer before our conversation should be interrupted by the return of his daughter and her husband whether he knew anything of martha ‘ah’ he rejoined shaking his head and looking very much dejected ‘no good a sad story sir however you come to know it i never thought there was harm in the girl i would not wish to mention it before my daughter minniefor she would take me up directlybut i never did none of us ever did’ mr omer hearing his daughter’s footstep before i heard it touched me with his pipe and shut up one eye as a caution she and her husband came in immediately afterwards their report was that mr barkis was ‘as bad as bad could be’ that he was quite unconscious and that mr chillip had mournfully said in the kitchen on going away just now that the college of physicians the college of surgeons and apothecaries’ hall if they were all called in together could not help him he was past both colleges mr chillip said and the hall could only poison him hearing this and learning that mr peggotty was there i determined to go to the house at once i bade good night to mr omer and to mr and mrs joram and directed my steps thither with a solemn feeling which made mr barkis quite a new and different creature my low tap at the door was answered by mr peggotty he was not so much surprised to see me as i had expected i remarked this in peggotty too when she came down and i have seen it since and i think in the expectation of that dread surprise all other changes and surprises dwindle into nothing i shook hands with mr peggotty and passed into the kitchen while he softly closed the door little emily was sitting by the fire with her hands before her face ham was standing near her we spoke in whispers listening between whiles for any sound in the room above i had not thought of it on the occasion of my last visit but how strange it was to me now to miss mr barkis out of the kitchen ‘this is very kind of you mas’r davy’ said mr peggotty ‘it is oncommon kind’ said ham ‘them’ly my dear’ cried mr peggotty ‘see here here is mas’r davy come what cheer up pretty not a wured to mas’r davy’ there was a trembling upon her that i can see now the coldness of her hand when i touched it i can feel yet its only sign of animation was to shrink from mine and then she glided from the chair and creeping to the other side of her uncle bowed herself silently and trembling still upon his breast ‘it is such a loving art’ said mr peggotty smoothing her rich hair with his great hard hand ‘that it cannot abear the sorrer of this it is nat’ral in young folk mas’r davy when they are new to these here trials and timid like my little birdit is nat’ral’ she clung the closer to him but neither lifted up her face nor spoke a word ‘it is getting late my dear’ said mr peggotty ‘and here is ham come fur to take you home theer go along with t’other loving art what’ them’ly eh my pretty’ the sound of her voice had not reached me but he bent his head as if he listened to her and then said ‘let you stay with your uncle why you doen’t mean to ask me that stay with your uncle moppet when your husband that will be so soon is here fur to take you home now a person would not think it fur to see this little thing alongside a roughweather chap like me’ said mr peggotty looking round at both of us with infinite pride ‘but the sea are not more salt in it than she has fondness in her for her unclea foolish little them’ly’ ‘them’ly’s in the right in that mas’r davy’ said ham ‘lookee here as them’ly wishes of it and as she is hurried and frightened like besides i will leave her till morning let me stay too’ ‘no no’ said mr peggotty ‘you doen’t oughta married man like youor what is as goodto take and hull away a day’s work and you doen’t ought to watch and work both that will not do you go home and turn in you are not afeerd of them’ly not being took good care on i know’ ham yielded to this persuasion and took his hat to go even when he kissed herand i never saw him approach her but i felt that nature had given him the soul of a gentlemanshe seemed to cling closer to her uncle even to the avoidance of her chosen husband i shut the door after him that it might cause no disturbance of the quiet that prevailed and when i turned back i found mr peggotty still talking to her ‘now i am a going upstairs to tell your aunt as mas’r davy’s here and that will cheer her up a bit’ he said ‘sit ye down by the fire the while my dear and warm those mortal cold hands you doen’t need to be so fearsome and take on so much what you will go along with mewell come along with mecome if her uncle was turned out of house and home and forced to lay down in a dyke mas’r davy’ said mr peggotty with no less pride than before ‘it is my belief she would go along with him now but there will be someone else soonsomeone else soon them’ly’ afterwards when i went upstairs as i passed the door of my little chamber which was dark i had an indistinct impression of her being within it cast down upon the floor but whether it was really she or whether it was a confusion of the shadows in the room i do not know now i had leisure to think before the kitchen fire of pretty little emily’s dread of deathwhich added to what mr omer had told me i took to be the because of her being so unlike herselfand i had leisure before peggotty came down even to think more leniently of the weakness of it as i sat counting the ticking of the clock and deepening my sense of the solemn hush around me peggotty took me in her arms and blessed and thanked me over and over again for being such a comfort to her that was what she said in her distress she then entreated me to come upstairs sobbing that mr barkis had always liked me and admired me that he had often talked of me before he fell into a stupor and that she believed in case of his coming to himself again he would brighten up at sight of me if he could brighten up at any earthly thing the probability of his ever doing so appeared to me when i saw him to be very small he was lying with his head and shoulders out of bed in an uncomfortable attitude half resting on the box which had cost him so much pain and trouble i learned that when he was past creeping out of bed to open it and past assuring himself of its safety by means of the divining rod i had seen him use he had required to have it placed on the chair at the bedside where he had ever since embraced it night and day his arm lay on it now time and the world were slipping from beneath him but the box was there and the last words he had uttered were in an explanatory tone ‘old clothes’ ‘barkis my dear’ said peggotty almost cheerfully bending over him while her brother and i stood at the bed’s foot ‘here is my dear boymy dear boy master davy who brought us together barkis that you sent messages by you know will not you speak to master davy’ he was as mute and senseless as the box from which his form derived the only expression it had ‘he is a going out with the tide’ said mr peggotty to me behind his hand my eyes were dim and so were mr peggotty’s but i repeated in a whisper ‘with the tide’ ‘people cannot die along the coast’ said mr peggotty ‘except when the tide’s pretty nigh out they cannot be born unless it is pretty nigh innot properly born till flood he is a going out with the tide it is ebb at halfarter three slack water half an hour if he lives till it turns he will hold his own till past the flood and go out with the next tide’ we remained there watching him a long timehours what mysterious influence my presence had upon him in that state of his senses i shall not pretend to say but when he at last began to wander feebly it is certain he was muttering about driving me to school ‘he is coming to himself’ said peggotty mr peggotty touched me and whispered with much awe and reverence ‘they are both agoing out fast’ ‘barkis my dear’ said peggotty ‘c p barkis’ he cried faintly ‘no better woman anywhere’ ‘look here is master davy’ said peggotty for he now opened his eyes i was on the point of asking him if he knew me when he tried to stretch out his arm and said to me distinctly with a pleasant smile ‘barkis is willin’’ and it being low water he went out with the tide
