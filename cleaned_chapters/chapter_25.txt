good and bad angels i was going out at my door on the morning after that deplorable day of headache sickness and repentance with an odd confusion in my mind relative to the date of my dinnerparty as if a body of titans had taken an enormous lever and pushed the day before yesterday some months back when i saw a ticketporter coming upstairs with a letter in his hand he was taking his time about his errand then but when he saw me on the top of the staircase looking at him over the banisters he swung into a trot and came up panting as if he had run himself into a state of exhaustion ‘t copperfield esquire’ said the ticketporter touching his hat with his little cane i could scarcely lay claim to the name i was so disturbed by the conviction that the letter came from agnes however i told him i was t copperfield esquire and he believed it and gave me the letter which he said required an answer i shut him out on the landing to wait for the answer and went into my chambers again in such a nervous state that i was fain to lay the letter down on my breakfast table and familiarize myself with the outside of it a little before i could resolve to break the seal i found when i did open it that it was a very kind note containing no reference to my condition at the theatre all it said was ‘my dear trotwood i am staying at the house of papa’s agent mr waterbrook in ely place holborn will you come and see me today at any time you like to appoint ever yours affectionately agnes’ it took me such a long time to write an answer at all to my satisfaction that i do not know what the ticketporter can have thought unless he thought i was learning to write i must have written halfadozen answers at least i began one ‘how can i ever hope my dear agnes to efface from your remembrance the disgusting impression’there i did not like it and then i tore it up i began another ‘shakespeare has observed my dear agnes how strange it is that a man should put an enemy into his mouth’that reminded me of markham and it got no farther i even tried poetry i began one note in a sixsyllable line ‘oh do not remember’but that associated itself with the fifth of november and became an absurdity after many attempts i wrote ‘my dear agnes your letter is like you and what could i say of it that would be higher praise than that i will come at four of the clock affectionately and sorrowfully tc’ with this missive which i was in twenty minds at once about recalling as soon as it was out of my hands the ticketporter at last departed if the day were half as tremendous to any other professional gentleman in doctors’ commons as it was to me i sincerely believe he made some expiation for his share in that rotten old ecclesiastical cheese although i left the office at half past three and was prowling about the place of appointment within a few minutes afterwards the appointed time was exceeded by a full quarter of an hour according to the clock of st andrew’s holborn before i could muster up sufficient desperation to pull the private bellhandle let into the lefthand doorpost of mr waterbrook’s house the professional business of mr waterbrook’s establishment was done on the groundfloor and the genteel business of which there was a good deal in the upper part of the building i was shown into a pretty but rather close drawingroom and there sat agnes netting a purse she looked so quiet and good and reminded me so strongly of my airy fresh school days at canterbury and the sodden smoky stupid wretch i had been the other night that nobody being by i yielded to my selfreproach and shame andin short made a fool of myself i cannot deny that i she would tears to this hour i am undecided whether it was upon the whole the wisest thing i could have done or the most ridiculous ‘if it had been anyone but you agnes’ said i turning away my head ‘i should not have minded it half so much but that it should have been you who saw me i almost wish i had been dead first’ she put her handits touch was like no other handupon my arm for a moment and i felt so befriended and comforted that i could not help moving it to my lips and gratefully kissing it ‘sit down’ said agnes cheerfully ‘do not be unhappy trotwood if you cannot confidently trust me whom will you trust’ ‘ah agnes’ i returned ‘you are my good angel’ she smiled rather sadly i thought and shook her head ‘yes agnes my good angel always my good angel’ ‘if i were indeed trotwood’ she returned ‘there is one thing that i should set my heart on very much’ i looked at her inquiringly but already with a foreknowledge of her meaning ‘on warning you’ said agnes with a steady glance ‘against your bad angel’ ‘my dear agnes’ i began ‘if you mean steerforth’ ‘i do trotwood’ she returned ‘then agnes you wrong him very much he my bad angel or anyone’s he anything but a guide a support and a friend to me my dear agnes now is it not unjust and unlike you to judge him from what you saw of me the other night’ ‘i do not judge him from what i saw of you the other night’ she quietly replied ‘from what then’ ‘from many thingstrifles in themselves but they do not seem to me to be so when they are put together i judge him partly from your account of him trotwood and your character and the influence he has over you’ there was always something in her modest voice that seemed to touch a chord within me answering to that sound alone it was always earnest but when it was very earnest as it was now there was a thrill in it that quite subdued me i sat looking at her as she cast her eyes down on her work i sat seeming still to listen to her and steerforth in spite of all my attachment to him darkened in that tone ‘it is very bold in me’ said agnes looking up again ‘who have lived in such seclusion and can know so little of the world to give you my advice so confidently or even to have this strong opinion but i know in what it is engendered trotwoodin how true a remembrance of our having grown up together and in how true an interest in all relating to you it is that which makes me bold i am certain that what i say is right i am quite sure it is i feel as if it were someone else speaking to you and not i when i caution you that you have made a dangerous friend’ again i looked at her again i listened to her after she was silent and again his image though it was still fixed in my heart darkened ‘i am not so unreasonable as to expect’ said agnes resuming her usual tone after a little while ‘that you will or that you can at once change any sentiment that has become a conviction to you least of all a sentiment that is rooted in your trusting disposition you ought not hastily to do that i only ask you trotwood if you ever think of mei mean’ with a quiet smile for i was going to interrupt her and she knew why ‘as often as you think of meto think of what i have said do you forgive me for all this’ ‘i will forgive you agnes’ i replied ‘when you come to do steerforth justice and to like him as well as i do’ ‘not until then’ said agnes i saw a passing shadow on her face when i made this mention of him but she returned my smile and we were again as unreserved in our mutual confidence as of old ‘and when agnes’ said i ‘will you forgive me the other night’ ‘when i recall it’ said agnes she would have dismissed the subject so but i was too full of it to allow that and insisted on telling her how it happened that i had disgraced myself and what chain of accidental circumstances had had the theatre for its final link it was a great relief to me to do this and to enlarge on the obligation that i owed to steerforth for his care of me when i was unable to take care of myself ‘you must not forget’ said agnes calmly changing the conversation as soon as i had concluded ‘that you are always to tell me not only when you fall into trouble but when you fall in love who has succeeded to miss larkins trotwood’ ‘no one agnes’ ‘someone trotwood’ said agnes laughing and holding up her finger ‘no agnes upon my word there is a lady certainly at mrs steerforth’s house who is very clever and whom i like to talk tomiss dartlebut i do not adore her’ agnes laughed again at her own penetration and told me that if i were faithful to her in my confidence she thought she should keep a little register of my violent attachments with the date duration and termination of each like the table of the reigns of the kings and queens in the history of england then she asked me if i had seen uriah ‘uriah heep’ said i ‘no is he in london’ ‘he comes to the office downstairs every day’ returned agnes ‘he was in london a week before me i am afraid on disagreeable business trotwood’ ‘on some business that makes you uneasy agnes i see’ said i ‘what can that be’ agnes laid aside her work and replied folding her hands upon one another and looking pensively at me out of those beautiful soft eyes of hers ‘i believe he is going to enter into partnership with papa’ ‘what uriah that mean fawning fellow worm himself into such promotion’ i cried indignantly ‘have you made no remonstrance about it agnes consider what a connexion it is likely to be you must speak out you must not allow your father to take such a mad step you must prevent it agnes while there is time’ still looking at me agnes shook her head while i was speaking with a faint smile at my warmth and then replied ‘you remember our last conversation about papa it was not long after thatnot more than two or three dayswhen he gave me the first intimation of what i tell you it was sad to see him struggling between his desire to represent it to me as a matter of choice on his part and his inability to conceal that it was forced upon him i felt very sorry’ ‘forced upon him agnes who forces it upon him’ ‘uriah’ she replied after a moment’s hesitation ‘has made himself indispensable to papa he is subtle and watchful he has mastered papa’s weaknesses fostered them and taken advantage of them untilto say all that i mean in a word trotwooduntil papa is afraid of him’ there was more that she might have said more that she knew or that she suspected i clearly saw i could not give her pain by asking what it was for i knew that she withheld it from me to spare her father it had long been going on to this i was sensible yes i could not but feel on the least reflection that it had been going on to this for a long time i remained silent ‘his ascendancy over papa’ said agnes ‘is very great he professes humility and gratitudewith truth perhaps i hope sobut his position is really one of power and i fear he makes a hard use of his power’ i said he was a hound which at the moment was a great satisfaction to me ‘at the time i speak of as the time when papa spoke to me’ pursued agnes ‘he had told papa that he was going away that he was very sorry and unwilling to leave but that he had better prospects papa was very much depressed then and more bowed down by care than ever you or i have seen him but he seemed relieved by this expedient of the partnership though at the same time he seemed hurt by it and ashamed of it’ ‘and how did you receive it agnes’ ‘i did trotwood’ she replied ‘what i hope was right feeling sure that it was necessary for papa’s peace that the sacrifice should be made i entreated him to make it i said it would lighten the load of his lifei hope it willand that it would give me increased opportunities of being his companion oh trotwood’ cried agnes putting her hands before her face as her tears started on it ‘i almost feel as if i had been papa’s enemy instead of his loving child for i know how he has altered in his devotion to me i know how he has narrowed the circle of his sympathies and duties in the concentration of his whole mind upon me i know what a multitude of things he has shut out for my sake and how his anxious thoughts of me have shadowed his life and weakened his strength and energy by turning them always upon one idea if i could ever set this right if i could ever work out his restoration as i have so innocently been the because of his decline’ i had never before seen agnes cry i had seen tears in her eyes when i had brought new honours home from school and i had seen them there when we last spoke about her father and i had seen her turn her gentle head aside when we took leave of one another but i had never seen her grieve like this it made me so sorry that i could only say in a foolish helpless manner ‘pray agnes do not do not my dear sister’ but agnes was too superior to me in character and purpose as i know well now whatever i might know or not know then to be long in need of my entreaties the beautiful calm manner which makes her so different in my remembrance from everybody else came back again as if a cloud had passed from a serene sky ‘we are not likely to remain alone much longer’ said agnes ‘and while i have an opportunity let me earnestly entreat you trotwood to be friendly to uriah do not repel him do not resent as i think you have a general disposition to do what may be uncongenial to you in him he may not deserve it for we know no certain ill of him in any case think first of papa and me’ agnes had no time to say more for the room door opened and mrs waterbrook who was a large ladyor who wore a large dress i do not exactly know which for i do not know which was dress and which was ladycame sailing in i had a dim recollection of having seen her at the theatre as if i had seen her in a pale magic lantern but she appeared to remember me perfectly and still to suspect me of being in a state of intoxication finding by degrees however that i was sober and i hope that i was a modest young gentleman mrs waterbrook softened towards me considerably and inquired firstly if i went much into the parks and secondly if i went much into society on my replying to both these questions in the negative it occurred to me that i fell again in her good opinion but she concealed the fact gracefully and invited me to dinner next day i accepted the invitation and took my leave making a call on uriah in the office as i went out and leaving a card for him in his absence when i went to dinner next day and on the street door being opened plunged into a vapourbath of haunch of mutton i divined that i was not the only guest for i immediately identified the ticketporter in disguise assisting the family servant and waiting at the foot of the stairs to carry up my name he looked to the best of his ability when he asked me for it confidentially as if he had never seen me before but well did i know him and well did he know me conscience made cowards of us both i found mr waterbrook to be a middleaged gentleman with a short throat and a good deal of shirtcollar who only wanted a black nose to be the portrait of a pugdog he told me he was happy to have the honour of making my acquaintance and when i had paid my homage to mrs waterbrook presented me with much ceremony to a very awful lady in a black velvet dress and a great black velvet hat whom i remember as looking like a near relation of hamlet’ssay his aunt mrs henry spiker was this lady’s name and her husband was there too so cold a man that his head instead of being grey seemed to be sprinkled with hoarfrost immense deference was shown to the henry spikers male and female which agnes told me was on account of mr henry spiker being solicitor to something or to somebody i forget what or which remotely connected with the treasury i found uriah heep among the company in a suit of black and in deep humility he told me when i shook hands with him that he was proud to be noticed by me and that he really felt obliged to me for my condescension i could have wished he had been less obliged to me for he hovered about me in his gratitude all the rest of the evening and whenever i said a word to agnes was sure with his shadowless eyes and cadaverous face to be looking gauntly down upon us from behind there were other guestsall iced for the occasion as it struck me like the wine but there was one who attracted my attention before he came in on account of my hearing him announced as mr traddles my mind flew back to salem house and could it be tommy i thought who used to draw the skeletons i looked for mr traddles with unusual interest he was a sober steadylooking young man of retiring manners with a comic head of hair and eyes that were rather wide open and he got into an obscure corner so soon that i had some difficulty in making him out at length i had a good view of him and either my vision deceived me or it was the old unfortunate tommy i made my way to mr waterbrook and said that i believed i had the pleasure of seeing an old schoolfellow there ‘indeed’ said mr waterbrook surprised ‘you are too young to have been at school with mr henry spiker’ ‘oh i do not mean him’ i returned ‘i mean the gentleman named traddles’ ‘oh aye aye indeed’ said my host with much diminished interest ‘possibly’ ‘if it is really the same person’ said i glancing towards him ‘it was at a place called salem house where we were together and he was an excellent fellow’ ‘oh yes traddles is a good fellow’ returned my host nodding his head with an air of toleration ‘traddles is quite a good fellow’ ‘it is a curious coincidence’ said i ‘it is really’ returned my host ‘quite a coincidence that traddles should be here at all as traddles was only invited this morning when the place at table intended to be occupied by mrs henry spiker’s brother became vacant in consequence of his indisposition a very gentlemanly man mrs henry spiker’s brother mr copperfield’ i murmured an assent which was full of feeling considering that i knew nothing at all about him and i inquired what mr traddles was by profession ‘traddles’ returned mr waterbrook ‘is a young man reading for the bar yes he is quite a good fellownobody’s enemy but his own’ ‘is he his own enemy’ said i sorry to hear this ‘well’ returned mr waterbrook pursing up his mouth and playing with his watchchain in a comfortable prosperous sort of way ‘i should say he was one of those men who stand in their own light yes i should say he would never for example be worth five hundred pound traddles was recommended to me by a professional friend oh yes yes he has a kind of talent for drawing briefs and stating a case in writing plainly i am able to throw something in traddles’s way in the course of the year somethingfor himconsiderable oh yes yes’ i was much impressed by the extremely comfortable and satisfied manner in which mr waterbrook delivered himself of this little word ‘yes’ every now and then there was wonderful expression in it it completely conveyed the idea of a man who had been born not to say with a silver spoon but with a scalingladder and had gone on mounting all the heights of life one after another until now he looked from the top of the fortifications with the eye of a philosopher and a patron on the people down in the trenches my reflections on this theme were still in progress when dinner was announced mr waterbrook went down with hamlet’s aunt mr henry spiker took mrs waterbrook agnes whom i should have liked to take myself was given to a simpering fellow with weak legs uriah traddles and i as the junior part of the company went down last how we could i was not so vexed at losing agnes as i might have been since it gave me an opportunity of making myself known to traddles on the stairs who greeted me with great fervour while uriah writhed with such obtrusive satisfaction and selfabasement that i could gladly have pitched him over the banisters traddles and i were separated at table being billeted in two remote corners he in the glare of a red velvet lady i in the gloom of hamlet’s aunt the dinner was very long and the conversation was about the aristocracyand blood mrs waterbrook repeatedly told us that if she had a weakness it was blood it occurred to me several times that we should have got on better if we had not been quite so genteel we were so exceedingly genteel that our scope was very limited a mr and mrs gulpidge were of the party who had something to do at secondhand at least mr gulpidge had with the law business of the bank and what with the bank and what with the treasury we were as exclusive as the court circular to mend the matter hamlet’s aunt had the family failing of indulging in soliloquy and held forth in a desultory manner by herself on every topic that was introduced these were few enough to be sure but as we always fell back upon blood she had as wide a field for abstract speculation as her nephew himself we might have been a party of ogres the conversation assumed such a sanguine complexion ‘i confess i am of mrs waterbrook’s opinion’ said mr waterbrook with his wineglass at his eye ‘other things are all very well in their way but give me blood’ ‘oh there is nothing’ observed hamlet’s aunt ‘so satisfactory to one there is nothing that is so much one’s beauideal ofof all that sort of thing speaking generally there are some low minds not many i am happy to believe but there are some that would prefer to do what i should call bow down before idols positively idols before service intellect and so on but these are intangible points blood is not so we see blood in a nose and we know it we meet with it in a chin and we say “there it is that is blood” it is an actual matter of fact we point it out it admits of no doubt’ the simpering fellow with the weak legs who had taken agnes down stated the question more decisively yet i thought ‘oh you know deuce take it’ said this gentleman looking round the board with an imbecile smile ‘we cannot forego blood you know we must have blood you know some young fellows you know may be a little behind their station perhaps in point of education and behaviour and may go a little wrong you know and get themselves and other people into a variety of fixesand all thatbut deuce take it it is delightful to reflect that they have got blood in ‘them myself i would rather at any time be knocked down by a man who had got blood in him than i would be picked up by a man who had not’ this sentiment as compressing the general question into a nutshell gave the utmost satisfaction and brought the gentleman into great notice until the ladies retired after that i observed that mr gulpidge and mr henry spiker who had hitherto been very distant entered into a defensive alliance against us the common enemy and exchanged a mysterious dialogue across the table for our defeat and overthrow ‘that affair of the first bond for four thousand five hundred pounds has not taken the course that was expected spiker’ said mr gulpidge ‘do you mean the d of a’s’ said mr spiker ‘the c of b’s’ said mr gulpidge mr spiker raised his eyebrows and looked much concerned ‘when the question was referred to lordi need not name him’ said mr gulpidge checking himself ‘i understand’ said mr spiker ‘n’ mr gulpidge darkly nodded‘was referred to him his answer was “money or no release”’ ‘lord bless my soul’ cried mr spiker “‘money or no release”’ repeated mr gulpidge firmly ‘the next in reversionyou understand me’ ‘k’ said mr spiker with an ominous look ‘k then positively refused to sign he was attended at newmarket for that purpose and he pointblank refused to do it’ mr spiker was so interested that he became quite stony ‘so the matter rests at this hour’ said mr gulpidge throwing himself back in his chair ‘our friend waterbrook will excuse me if i forbear to explain myself generally on account of the magnitude of the interests involved’ mr waterbrook was only too happy as it appeared to me to have such interests and such names even hinted at across his table he assumed an expression of gloomy intelligence though i am persuaded he knew no more about the discussion than i did and highly approved of the discretion that had been observed mr spiker after the receipt of such a confidence naturally desired to favour his friend with a confidence of his own therefore the foregoing dialogue was succeeded by another in which it was mr gulpidge’s turn to be surprised and that by another in which the surprise came round to mr spiker’s turn again and so on turn and turn about all this time we the outsiders remained oppressed by the tremendous interests involved in the conversation and our host regarded us with pride as the victims of a salutary awe and astonishment i was very glad indeed to get upstairs to agnes and to talk with her in a corner and to introduce traddles to her who was shy but agreeable and the same goodnatured creature still as he was obliged to leave early on account of going away next morning for a month i had not nearly so much conversation with him as i could have wished but we exchanged addresses and promised ourselves the pleasure of another meeting when he should come back to town he was greatly interested to hear that i knew steerforth and spoke of him with such warmth that i made him tell agnes what he thought of him but agnes only looked at me the while and very slightly shook her head when only i observed her as she was not among people with whom i believed she could be very much at home i was almost glad to hear that she was going away within a few days though i was sorry at the prospect of parting from her again so soon this caused me to remain until all the company were gone conversing with her and hearing her sing was such a delightful reminder to me of my happy life in the grave old house she had made so beautiful that i could have remained there half the night but having no excuse for staying any longer when the lights of mr waterbrook’s society were all snuffed out i took my leave very much against my inclination i felt then more than ever that she was my better angel and if i thought of her sweet face and placid smile as though they had shone on me from some removed being like an angel i hope i thought no harm i have said that the company were all gone but i ought to have excepted uriah whom i do not include in that denomination and who had never ceased to hover near us he was close behind me when i went downstairs he was close beside me when i walked away from the house slowly fitting his long skeleton fingers into the still longer fingers of a great guy fawkes pair of gloves it was in no disposition for uriah’s company but in remembrance of the entreaty agnes had made to me that i asked him if he would come home to my rooms and have some coffee ‘oh really master copperfield’ he rejoined‘i beg your pardon mister copperfield but the other comes so natural i do not like that you should put a constraint upon yourself to ask a numble person like me to your ouse’ ‘there is no constraint in the case’ said i ‘will you come’ ‘i should like to very much’ replied uriah with a writhe ‘well then come along’ said i i could not help being rather short with him but he appeared not to mind it we went the nearest way without conversing much upon the road and he was so humble in respect of those scarecrow gloves that he was still putting them on and seemed to have made no advance in that labour when we got to my place i led him up the dark stairs to prevent his knocking his head against anything and really his damp cold hand felt so like a frog in mine that i was tempted to drop it and run away agnes and hospitality prevailed however and i conducted him to my fireside when i lighted my candles he fell into meek transports with the room that was revealed to him and when i heated the coffee in an unassuming blocktin vessel in which mrs crupp delighted to prepare it chiefly i believe because it was not intended for the purpose being a shavingpot and because there was a patent invention of great price mouldering away in the pantry he professed so much emotion that i could joyfully have scalded him ‘oh really master copperfieldi mean mister copperfield’ said uriah ‘to see you waiting upon me is what i never could have expected but one way and another so many things happen to me which i never could have expected i am sure in my umble station that it seems to rain blessings on my ed you have heard something i dessay of a change in my expectations master copperfieldi should say mister copperfield’ as he sat on my sofa with his long knees drawn up under his coffeecup his hat and gloves upon the ground close to him his spoon going softly round and round his shadowless red eyes which looked as if they had scorched their lashes off turned towards me without looking at me the disagreeable dints i have formerly described in his nostrils coming and going with his breath and a snaky undulation pervading his frame from his chin to his boots i decided in my own mind that i disliked him intensely it made me very uncomfortable to have him for a guest for i was young then and unused to disguise what i so strongly felt ‘you have heard something i dessay of a change in my expectations master copperfieldi should say mister copperfield’ observed uriah ‘yes’ said i ‘something’ ‘ah i thought miss agnes would know of it’ he quietly returned ‘i am glad to find miss agnes knows of it oh thank you mastermister copperfield’ i could have thrown my bootjack at him it lay ready on the rug for having entrapped me into the disclosure of anything concerning agnes however immaterial but i only drank my coffee ‘what a prophet you have shown yourself mister copperfield’ pursued uriah ‘dear me what a prophet you have proved yourself to be do not you remember saying to me once that perhaps i should be a partner in mr wickfield’s business and perhaps it might be wickfield and heep you may not recollect it but when a person is umble master copperfield a person treasures such things up’ ‘i recollect talking about it’ said i ‘though i certainly did not think it very likely then’ ‘oh who would have thought it likely mister copperfield’ returned uriah enthusiastically ‘i am sure i did not myself i recollect saying with my own lips that i was much too umble so i considered myself really and truly’ he sat with that carved grin on his face looking at the fire as i looked at him ‘but the umblest persons master copperfield’ he presently resumed ‘may be the instruments of good i am glad to think i have been the instrument of good to mr wickfield and that i may be more so oh what a worthy man he is mister copperfield but how imprudent he has been’ ‘i am sorry to hear it’ said i i could not help adding rather pointedly ‘on all accounts’ ‘decidedly so mister copperfield’ replied uriah ‘on all accounts miss agnes’s above all you do not remember your own eloquent expressions master copperfield but i remember how you said one day that everybody must admire her and how i thanked you for it you have forgot that i have no doubt master copperfield’ ‘no’ said i drily ‘oh how glad i am you have not’ exclaimed uriah ‘to think that you should be the first to kindle the sparks of ambition in my umble breast and that you have not forgot it ohwould you excuse me asking for a cup more coffee’ something in the emphasis he laid upon the kindling of those sparks and something in the glance he directed at me as he said it had made me start as if i had seen him illuminated by a blaze of light recalled by his request preferred in quite another tone of voice i did the honours of the shavingpot but i did them with an unsteadiness of hand a sudden sense of being no match for him and a perplexed suspicious anxiety as to what he might be going to say next which i felt could not escape his observation he said nothing at all he stirred his coffee round and round he sipped it he felt his chin softly with his grisly hand he looked at the fire he looked about the room he gasped rather than smiled at me he writhed and undulated about in his deferential servility he stirred and sipped again but he left the renewal of the conversation to me ‘so mr wickfield’ said i at last ‘who is worth five hundred of youor me’ for my life i think i could not have helped dividing that part of the sentence with an awkward jerk ‘has been imprudent has he mr heep’ ‘oh very imprudent indeed master copperfield’ returned uriah sighing modestly ‘oh very much so but i wish you would call me uriah if you please it is like old times’ ‘well uriah’ said i bolting it out with some difficulty ‘thank you’ he returned with fervour ‘thank you master copperfield it is like the blowing of old breezes or the ringing of old bellses to hear you say uriah i beg your pardon was i making any observation’ ‘about mr wickfield’ i suggested ‘oh yes truly’ said uriah ‘ah great imprudence master copperfield it is a topic that i would not touch upon to any soul but you even to you i can only touch upon it and no more if anyone else had been in my place during the last few years by this time he would have had mr wickfield oh what a worthy man he is master copperfield too under his thumb underhis thumb’ said uriah very slowly as he stretched out his cruellooking hand above my table and pressed his own thumb upon it until it shook and shook the room if i had been obliged to look at him with him splay foot on mr wickfield’s head i think i could scarcely have hated him more ‘oh dear yes master copperfield’ he proceeded in a soft voice most remarkably contrasting with the action of his thumb which did not diminish its hard pressure in the least degree ‘there is no doubt of it there would have been loss disgrace i do not know what at all mr wickfield knows it i am the umble instrument of umbly serving him and he puts me on an eminence i hardly could have hoped to reach how thankful should i be’ with his face turned towards me as he finished but without looking at me he took his crooked thumb off the spot where he had planted it and slowly and thoughtfully scraped his lank jaw with it as if he were shaving himself i recollect well how indignantly my heart beat as i saw his crafty face with the appropriately red light of the fire upon it preparing for something else ‘master copperfield’ he began‘but am i keeping you up’ ‘you are not keeping me up i generally go to bed late’ ‘thank you master copperfield i have risen from my umble station since first you used to address me it is true but i am umble still i hope i never shall be otherwise than umble you will not think the worse of my umbleness if i make a little confidence to you master copperfield will you’ ‘oh no’ said i with an effort ‘thank you’ he took out his pockethandkerchief and began wiping the palms of his hands ‘miss agnes master copperfield’ ‘well uriah’ ‘oh how pleasant to be called uriah spontaneously’ he cried and gave himself a jerk like a convulsive fish ‘you thought her looking very beautiful tonight master copperfield’ ‘i thought her looking as she always does superior in all respects to everyone around her’ i returned ‘oh thank you it is so true’ he cried ‘oh thank you very much for that’ ‘not at all’ i said loftily ‘there is no reason why you should thank me’ ‘why that master copperfield’ said uriah ‘is in fact the confidence that i am going to take the liberty of reposing umble as i am’ he wiped his hands harder and looked at them and at the fire by turns ‘umble as my mother is and lowly as our poor but honest roof has ever been the image of miss agnes i do not mind trusting you with my secret master copperfield for i have always overflowed towards you since the first moment i had the pleasure of beholding you in a ponyshay has been in my breast for years oh master copperfield with what a pure affection do i love the ground my agnes walks on’ i believe i had a delirious idea of seizing the redhot poker out of the fire and running him through with it it went from me with a shock like a ball fired from a rifle but the image of agnes outraged by so much as a thought of this redheaded animal’s remained in my mind when i looked at him sitting all awry as if his mean soul griped his body and made me giddy he seemed to swell and grow before my eyes the room seemed full of the echoes of his voice and the strange feeling to which perhaps no one is quite a stranger that all this had occurred before at some indefinite time and that i knew what he was going to say next took possession of me a timely observation of the sense of power that there was in his face did more to bring back to my remembrance the entreaty of agnes in its full force than any effort i could have made i asked him with a better appearance of composure than i could have thought possible a minute before whether he had made his feelings known to agnes ‘oh no master copperfield’ he returned ‘oh dear no not to anyone but you you see i am only just emerging from my lowly station i rest a good deal of hope on her observing how useful i am to her father for i trust to be very useful to him indeed master copperfield and how i smooth the way for him and keep him straight she is so much attached to her father master copperfield oh what a lovely thing it is in a daughter that i think she may come on his account to be kind to me’ i fathomed the depth of the rascal’s whole scheme and understood why he laid it bare ‘if you will have the goodness to keep my secret master copperfield’ he pursued ‘and not in general to go against me i shall take it as a particular favour you would not wish to make unpleasantness i know what a friendly heart you have got but having only known me on my umble footing on my umblest i should say for i am very umble still you might unbeknown go against me rather with my agnes i call her mine you see master copperfield there is a song that says “i would crowns resign to call her mine” i hope to do it one of these days’ dear agnes so much too loving and too good for anyone that i could think of was it possible that she was reserved to be the wife of such a wretch as this ‘there is no hurry at present you know master copperfield’ uriah proceeded in his slimy way as i sat gazing at him with this thought in my mind ‘my agnes is very young still and mother and me will have to work our way upwards and make a good many new arrangements before it would be quite convenient so i shall have time gradually to make her familiar with my hopes as opportunities offer oh i am so much obliged to you for this confidence oh it is such a relief you cannot think to know that you understand our situation and are certain as you would not wish to make unpleasantness in the family not to go against me’ he took the hand which i dared not withhold and having given it a damp squeeze referred to his palefaced watch ‘dear me’ he said ‘it is past one the moments slip away so in the confidence of old times master copperfield that it is almost half past one’ i answered that i had thought it was later not that i had really thought so but because my conversational powers were effectually scattered ‘dear me’ he said considering ‘the ouse that i am stopping ata sort of a private hotel and boarding ouse master copperfield near the new river edwill have gone to bed these two hours’ ‘i am sorry’ i returned ‘that there is only one bed here and that i’ ‘oh do not think of mentioning beds master copperfield’ he rejoined ecstatically drawing up one leg ‘but would you have any objections to my laying down before the fire’ ‘if it comes to that’ i said ‘pray take my bed and i will lie down before the fire’ his repudiation of this offer was almost shrill enough in the excess of its surprise and humility to have penetrated to the ears of mrs crupp then sleeping i suppose in a distant chamber situated at about the level of lowwater mark soothed in her slumbers by the ticking of an incorrigible clock to which she always referred me when we had any little difference on the score of punctuality and which was never less than threequarters of an hour too slow and had always been put right in the morning by the best authorities as no arguments i could urge in my bewildered condition had the least effect upon his modesty in inducing him to accept my bedroom i was obliged to make the best arrangements i could for his repose before the fire the mattress of the sofa which was a great deal too short for his lank figure the sofa pillows a blanket the tablecover a clean breakfastcloth and a greatcoat made him a bed and covering for which he was more than thankful having lent him a nightcap which he put on at once and in which he made such an awful figure that i have never worn one since i left him to his rest i never shall forget that night i never shall forget how i turned and tumbled how i wearied myself with thinking about agnes and this creature how i considered what could i do and what ought i to do how i could come to no other conclusion than that the best course for her peace was to do nothing and to keep to myself what i had heard if i went to sleep for a few moments the image of agnes with her tender eyes and of her father looking fondly on her as i had so often seen him look arose before me with appealing faces and filled me with vague terrors when i awoke the recollection that uriah was lying in the next room sat heavy on me like a waking nightmare and oppressed me with a leaden dread as if i had had some meaner quality of devil for a lodger the poker got into my dozing thoughts besides and would not come out i thought between sleeping and waking that it was still red hot and i had snatched it out of the fire and run him through the body i was so haunted at last by the idea though i knew there was nothing in it that i stole into the next room to look at him there i saw him lying on his back with his legs extending to i do not know where gurglings taking place in his throat stoppages in his nose and his mouth open like a postoffice he was so much worse in reality than in my distempered fancy that afterwards i was attracted to him in very repulsion and could not help wandering in and out every halfhour or so and taking another look at him still the long long night seemed heavy and hopeless as ever and no promise of day was in the murky sky when i saw him going downstairs early in the morning for thank heaven he would not stay to breakfast it appeared to me as if the night was going away in his person when i went out to the commons i charged mrs crupp with particular directions to leave the windows open that my sittingroom might be aired and purged of his presence
