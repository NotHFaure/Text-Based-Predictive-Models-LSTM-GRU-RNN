wickfield and heep my aunt beginning i imagine to be made seriously uncomfortable by my prolonged dejection made a pretence of being anxious that i should go to dover to see that all was working well at the cottage which was let and to conclude an agreement with the same tenant for a longer term of occupation janet was drafted into the service of mrs strong where i saw her every day she had been undecided on leaving dover whether or no to give the finishing touch to that renunciation of mankind in which she had been educated by marrying a pilot but she decided against that venture not so much for the sake of principle i believe as because she happened not to like him although it required an effort to leave miss mills i fell rather willingly into my aunt’s pretence as a means of enabling me to pass a few tranquil hours with agnes i consulted the good doctor relative to an absence of three days and the doctor wishing me to take that relaxationhe wished me to take more but my energy could not bear thati made up my mind to go as to the commons i had no great occasion to be particular about my duties in that quarter to say the truth we were getting in no very good odour among the tiptop proctors and were rapidly sliding down to but a doubtful position the business had been indifferent under mr jorkins before mr spenlow’s time and although it had been quickened by the infusion of new blood and by the display which mr spenlow made still it was not established on a sufficiently strong basis to bear without being shaken such a blow as the sudden loss of its active manager it fell off very much mr jorkins notwithstanding his reputation in the firm was an easygoing incapable sort of man whose reputation out of doors was not calculated to back it up i was turned over to him now and when i saw him take his snuff and let the business go i regretted my aunt’s thousand pounds more than ever but this was not the worst of it there were a number of hangerson and outsiders about the commons who without being proctors themselves dabbled in commonform business and got it done by real proctors who lent their names in consideration of a share in the spoiland there were a good many of these too as our house now wanted business on any terms we joined this noble band and threw out lures to the hangerson and outsiders to bring their business to us marriage licences and small probates were what we all looked for and what paid us best and the competition for these ran very high indeed kidnappers and inveiglers were planted in all the avenues of entrance to the commons with instructions to do their utmost to cut off all persons in mourning and all gentlemen with anything bashful in their appearance and entice them to the offices in which their respective employers were interested which instructions were so well observed that i myself before i was known by sight was twice hustled into the premises of our principal opponent the conflicting interests of these touting gentlemen being of a nature to irritate their feelings personal collisions took place and the commons was even scandalized by our principal inveigler who had formerly been in the wine trade and afterwards in the sworn brokery line walking about for some days with a black eye any one of these scouts used to think nothing of politely assisting an old lady in black out of a vehicle killing any proctor whom she inquired for representing his employer as the lawful successor and representative of that proctor and bearing the old lady off sometimes greatly affected to his employer’s office many captives were brought to me in this way as to marriage licences the competition rose to such a pitch that a shy gentleman in want of one had nothing to do but submit himself to the first inveigler or be fought for and become the prey of the strongest one of our clerks who was an outsider used in the height of this contest to sit with his hat on that he might be ready to rush out and swear before a surrogate any victim who was brought in the system of inveigling continues i believe to this day the last time i was in the commons a civil ablebodied person in a white apron pounced out upon me from a doorway and whispering the word ‘marriagelicence’ in my ear was with great difficulty prevented from taking me up in his arms and lifting me into a proctor’s from this digression let me proceed to dover i found everything in a satisfactory state at the cottage and was enabled to gratify my aunt exceedingly by reporting that the tenant inherited her feud and waged incessant war against donkeys having settled the little business i had to transact there and slept there one night i walked on to canterbury early in the morning it was now winter again and the fresh cold windy day and the sweeping downland brightened up my hopes a little coming into canterbury i loitered through the old streets with a sober pleasure that calmed my spirits and eased my heart there were the old signs the old names over the shops the old people serving in them it appeared so long since i had been a schoolboy there that i wondered the place was so little changed until i reflected how little i was changed myself strange to say that quiet influence which was inseparable in my mind from agnes seemed to pervade even the city where she dwelt the venerable cathedral towers and the old jackdaws and rooks whose airy voices made them more retired than perfect silence would have done the battered gateways one stuck full with statues long thrown down and crumbled away like the reverential pilgrims who had gazed upon them the still nooks where the ivied growth of centuries crept over gabled ends and ruined walls the ancient houses the pastoral landscape of field orchard and garden everywhereon everythingi felt the same serener air the same calm thoughtful softening spirit arrived at mr wickfield’s house i found in the little lower room on the ground floor where uriah heep had been of old accustomed to sit mr micawber plying his pen with great assiduity he was dressed in a legallooking suit of black and loomed burly and large in that small office mr micawber was extremely glad to see me but a little confused too he would have conducted me immediately into the presence of uriah but i declined ‘i know the house of old you recollect’ said i ‘and will find my way upstairs how do you like the law mr micawber’ ‘my dear copperfield’ he replied ‘to a man possessed of the higher imaginative powers the objection to legal studies is the amount of detail which they involve even in our professional correspondence’ said mr micawber glancing at some letters he was writing ‘the mind is not at liberty to soar to any exalted form of expression still it is a great pursuit a great pursuit’ he then told me that he had become the tenant of uriah heep’s old house and that mrs micawber would be delighted to receive me once more under her own roof ‘it is humble’ said mr micawber ‘to quote a favourite expression of my friend heep but it may prove the steppingstone to more ambitious domiciliary accommodation’ i asked him whether he had reason so far to be satisfied with his friend heep’s treatment of him he got up to ascertain if the door were close shut before he replied in a lower voice ‘my dear copperfield a man who labours under the pressure of pecuniary embarrassments is with the generality of people at a disadvantage that disadvantage is not diminished when that pressure necessitates the drawing of stipendiary emoluments before those emoluments are strictly due and payable all i can say is that my friend heep has responded to appeals to which i need not more particularly refer in a manner calculated to redound equally to the honour of his head and of his heart’ ‘i should not have supposed him to be very free with his money either’ i observed ‘pardon me’ said mr micawber with an air of constraint ‘i speak of my friend heep as i have experience’ ‘i am glad your experience is so favourable’ i returned ‘you are very obliging my dear copperfield’ said mr micawber and hummed a tune ‘do you see much of mr wickfield’ i asked to change the subject ‘not much’ said mr micawber slightingly ‘mr wickfield is i dare say a man of very excellent intentions but he isin short he is obsolete’ ‘i am afraid his partner seeks to make him so’ said i ‘my dear copperfield’ returned mr micawber after some uneasy evolutions on his stool ‘allow me to offer a remark i am here in a capacity of confidence i am here in a position of trust the discussion of some topics even with mrs micawber herself so long the partner of my various vicissitudes and a woman of a remarkable lucidity of intellect is i am led to consider incompatible with the functions now devolving on me i would therefore take the liberty of suggesting that in our friendly intercoursewhich i trust will never be disturbedwe draw a line on one side of this line’ said mr micawber representing it on the desk with the office ruler ‘is the whole range of the human intellect with a trifling exception on the other is that exception that is to say the affairs of messrs wickfield and heep with all belonging and appertaining thereunto i trust i give no offence to the companion of my youth in submitting this proposition to his cooler judgement’ though i saw an uneasy change in mr micawber which sat tightly on him as if his new duties were a misfit i felt i had no right to be offended my telling him so appeared to relieve him and he shook hands with me ‘i am charmed copperfield’ said mr micawber ‘let me assure you with miss wickfield she is a very superior young lady of very remarkable attractions graces and virtues upon my honour’ said mr micawber indefinitely kissing his hand and bowing with his genteelest air ‘i do homage to miss wickfield hem’ ‘i am glad of that at least’ said i ‘if you had not assured us my dear copperfield on the occasion of that agreeable afternoon we had the happiness of passing with you that d was your favourite letter’ said mr micawber ‘i should unquestionably have supposed that a had been so’ we have all some experience of a feeling that comes over us occasionally of what we are saying and doing having been said and done before in a remote timeof our having been surrounded dim ages ago by the same faces objects and circumstancesof our knowing perfectly what will be said next as if we suddenly remembered it i never had this mysterious impression more strongly in my life than before he uttered those words i took my leave of mr micawber for the time charging him with my best remembrances to all at home as i left him resuming his stool and his pen and rolling his head in his stock to get it into easier writing order i clearly perceived that there was something interposed between him and me since he had come into his new functions which prevented our getting at each other as we used to do and quite altered the character of our intercourse there was no one in the quaint old drawingroom though it presented tokens of mrs heep’s whereabouts i looked into the room still belonging to agnes and saw her sitting by the fire at a pretty oldfashioned desk she had writing my darkening the light made her look up what a pleasure to be the because of that bright change in her attentive face and the object of that sweet regard and welcome ‘ah agnes’ said i when we were sitting together side by side ‘i have missed you so much lately’ ‘indeed’ she replied ‘again and so soon’ i shook my head ‘i do not know how it is agnes i seem to want some faculty of mind that i ought to have you were so much in the habit of thinking for me in the happy old days here and i came so naturally to you for counsel and support that i really think i have missed acquiring it’ ‘and what is it’ said agnes cheerfully ‘i do not know what to call it’ i replied ‘i think i am earnest and persevering’ ‘i am sure of it’ said agnes ‘and patient agnes’ i inquired with a little hesitation ‘yes’ returned agnes laughing ‘pretty well’ ‘and yet’ said i ‘i get so miserable and worried and am so unsteady and irresolute in my power of assuring myself that i know i must wantshall i call itreliance of some kind’ ‘call it so if you will’ said agnes ‘well’ i returned ‘see here you come to london i rely on you and i have an object and a course at once i am driven out of it i come here and in a moment i feel an altered person the circumstances that distressed me are not changed since i came into this room but an influence comes over me in that short interval that alters me oh how much for the better what is it what is your secret agnes’ her head was bent down looking at the fire ‘it is the old story’ said i ‘do not laugh when i say it was always the same in little things as it is in greater ones my old troubles were nonsense and now they are serious but whenever i have gone away from my adopted sister’ agnes looked upwith such a heavenly faceand gave me her hand which i kissed ‘whenever i have not had you agnes to advise and approve in the beginning i have seemed to go wild and to get into all sorts of difficulty when i have come to you at last as i have always done i have come to peace and happiness i come home now like a tired traveller and find such a blessed sense of rest’ i felt so deeply what i said it affected me so sincerely that my voice failed and i covered my face with my hand and broke into tears i write the truth whatever contradictions and inconsistencies there were within me as there are within so many of us whatever might have been so different and so much better whatever i had done in which i had perversely wandered away from the voice of my own heart i knew nothing of i only knew that i was fervently in earnest when i felt the rest and peace of having agnes near me in her placid sisterly manner with her beaming eyes with her tender voice and with that sweet composure which had long ago made the house that held her quite a sacred place to me she soon won me from this weakness and led me on to tell all that had happened since our last meeting ‘and there is not another word to tell agnes’ said i when i had made an end of my confidence ‘now my reliance is on you’ ‘but it must not be on me trotwood’ returned agnes with a pleasant smile ‘it must be on someone else’ ‘on dora’ said i ‘assuredly’ ‘why i have not mentioned agnes’ said i a little embarrassed ‘that dora is rather difficult toi would not for the world say to rely upon because she is the soul of purity and truthbut rather difficult toi hardly know how to express it really agnes she is a timid little thing and easily disturbed and frightened some time ago before her father’s death when i thought it right to mention to herbut i will tell you if you will bear with me how it was’ accordingly i told agnes about my declaration of poverty about the cookerybook the housekeeping accounts and all the rest of it ‘oh trotwood’ she remonstrated with a smile ‘just your old headlong way you might have been in earnest in striving to get on in the world without being so very sudden with a timid loving inexperienced girl poor dora’ i never heard such sweet forbearing kindness expressed in a voice as she expressed in making this reply it was as if i had seen her admiringly and tenderly embracing dora and tacitly reproving me by her considerate protection for my hot haste in fluttering that little heart it was as if i had seen dora in all her fascinating artlessness caressing agnes and thanking her and coaxingly appealing against me and loving me with all her childish innocence i felt so grateful to agnes and admired her so i saw those two together in a bright perspective such wellassociated friends each adorning the other so much ‘what ought i to do then agnes’ i inquired after looking at the fire a little while ‘what would it be right to do’ ‘i think’ said agnes ‘that the honourable course to take would be to write to those two ladies do not you think that any secret course is an unworthy one’ ‘yes if you think so’ said i ‘i am poorly qualified to judge of such matters’ replied agnes with a modest hesitation ‘but i certainly feelin short i feel that your being secret and clandestine is not being like yourself’ ‘like myself in the too high opinion you have of me agnes i am afraid’ said i ‘like yourself in the candour of your nature’ she returned ‘and therefore i would write to those two ladies i would relate as plainly and as openly as possible all that has taken place and i would ask their permission to visit sometimes at their house considering that you are young and striving for a place in life i think it would be well to say that you would readily abide by any conditions they might impose upon you i would entreat them not to dismiss your request without a reference to dora and to discuss it with her when they should think the time suitable i would not be too vehement’ said agnes gently ‘or propose too much i would trust to my fidelity and perseveranceand to dora’ ‘but if they were to frighten dora again agnes by speaking to her’ said i ‘and if dora were to cry and say nothing about me’ ‘is that likely’ inquired agnes with the same sweet consideration in her face ‘god bless her she is as easily scared as a bird’ said i ‘it might be or if the two miss spenlows elderly ladies of that sort are odd characters sometimes should not be likely persons to address in that way’ ‘i do not think trotwood’ returned agnes raising her soft eyes to mine ‘i would consider that perhaps it would be better only to consider whether it is right to do this and if it is to do it’ i had no longer any doubt on the subject with a lightened heart though with a profound sense of the weighty importance of my task i devoted the whole afternoon to the composition of the draft of this letter for which great purpose agnes relinquished her desk to me but first i went downstairs to see mr wickfield and uriah heep i found uriah in possession of a new plastersmelling office built out in the garden looking extraordinarily mean in the midst of a quantity of books and papers he received me in his usual fawning way and pretended not to have heard of my arrival from mr micawber a pretence i took the liberty of disbelieving he accompanied me into mr wickfield’s room which was the shadow of its former selfhaving been divested of a variety of conveniences for the accommodation of the new partnerand stood before the fire warming his back and shaving his chin with his bony hand while mr wickfield and i exchanged greetings ‘you stay with us trotwood while you remain in canterbury’ said mr wickfield not without a glance at uriah for his approval ‘is there room for me’ said i ‘i am sure master copperfieldi should say mister but the other comes so natural’ said uriah‘i would turn out of your old room with pleasure if it would be agreeable’ ‘no no’ said mr wickfield ‘why should you be inconvenienced there is another room there is another room’ ‘oh but you know’ returned uriah with a grin ‘i should really be delighted’ to cut the matter short i said i would have the other room or none at all so it was settled that i should have the other room and taking my leave of the firm until dinner i went upstairs again i had hoped to have no other companion than agnes but mrs heep had asked permission to bring herself and her knitting near the fire in that room on pretence of its having an aspect more favourable for her rheumatics as the wind then was than the drawingroom or diningparlour though i could almost have consigned her to the mercies of the wind on the topmost pinnacle of the cathedral without remorse i made a virtue of necessity and gave her a friendly salutation ‘i am umbly thankful to you sir’ said mrs heep in acknowledgement of my inquiries concerning her health ‘but i am only pretty well i have not much to boast of if i could see my uriah well settled in life i could not expect much more i think how do you think my ury looking sir’ i thought him looking as villainous as ever and i replied that i saw no change in him ‘oh do not you think he is changed’ said mrs heep ‘there i must umbly beg leave to differ from you do not you see a thinness in him’ ‘not more than usual’ i replied ‘do not you though’ said mrs heep ‘but you do not take notice of him with a mother’s eye’ his mother’s eye was an evil eye to the rest of the world i thought as it met mine howsoever affectionate to him and i believe she and her son were devoted to one another it passed me and went on to agnes ‘do not you see a wasting and a wearing in him miss wickfield’ inquired mrs heep ‘no’ said agnes quietly pursuing the work on which she was engaged ‘you are too solicitous about him he is very well’ mrs heep with a prodigious sniff resumed her knitting she never left off or left us for a moment i had arrived early in the day and we had still three or four hours before dinner but she sat there plying her knittingneedles as monotonously as an hourglass might have poured out its sands she sat on one side of the fire i sat at the desk in front of it a little beyond me on the other side sat agnes whensoever slowly pondering over my letter i lifted up my eyes and meeting the thoughtful face of agnes saw it clear and beam encouragement upon me with its own angelic expression i was conscious presently of the evil eye passing me and going on to her and coming back to me again and dropping furtively upon the knitting what the knitting was i do not know not being learned in that art but it looked like a net and as she worked away with those chinese chopsticks of knittingneedles she showed in the firelight like an illlooking enchantress baulked as yet by the radiant goodness opposite but getting ready for a cast of her net by and by at dinner she maintained her watch with the same unwinking eyes after dinner her son took his turn and when mr wickfield himself and i were left alone together leered at me and writhed until i could hardly bear it in the drawingroom there was the mother knitting and watching again all the time that agnes sang and played the mother sat at the piano once she asked for a particular ballad which she said her ury who was yawning in a great chair doted on and at intervals she looked round at him and reported to agnes that he was in raptures with the music but she hardly ever spokei question if she ever didwithout making some mention of him it was evident to me that this was the duty assigned to her this lasted until bedtime to have seen the mother and son like two great bats hanging over the whole house and darkening it with their ugly forms made me so uncomfortable that i would rather have remained downstairs knitting and all than gone to bed i hardly got any sleep next day the knitting and watching began again and lasted all day i had not an opportunity of speaking to agnes for ten minutes i could barely show her my letter i proposed to her to walk out with me but mrs heep repeatedly complaining that she was worse agnes charitably remained within to bear her company towards the twilight i went out by myself musing on what i ought to do and whether i was justified in withholding from agnes any longer what uriah heep had told me in london for that began to trouble me again very much i had not walked out far enough to be quite clear of the town upon the ramsgate road where there was a good path when i was hailed through the dust by somebody behind me the shambling figure and the scanty greatcoat were not to be mistaken i stopped and uriah heep came up ‘well’ said i ‘how fast you walk’ said he ‘my legs are pretty long but you have given ‘them quite a job’ ‘where are you going’ said i ‘i am going with you master copperfield if you will allow me the pleasure of a walk with an old acquaintance’ saying this with a jerk of his body which might have been either propitiatory or derisive he fell into step beside me ‘uriah’ said i as civilly as i could after a silence ‘master copperfield’ said uriah ‘to tell you the truth at which you will not be offended i came out to walk alone because i have had so much company’ he looked at me sideways and said with his hardest grin ‘you mean mother’ ‘why yes i do’ said i ‘ah but you know we are so very umble’ he returned ‘and having such a knowledge of our own umbleness we must really take care that we are not pushed to the wall by them as is not umble all stratagems are fair in love sir’ raising his great hands until they touched his chin he rubbed them softly and softly chuckled looking as like a malevolent baboon i thought as anything human could look ‘you see’ he said still hugging himself in that unpleasant way and shaking his head at me ‘you are quite a dangerous rival master copperfield you always was you know’ ‘do you set a watch upon miss wickfield and make her home no home because of me’ said i ‘oh master copperfield those are very arsh words’ he replied ‘put my meaning into any words you like’ said i ‘you know what it is uriah as well as i do’ ‘oh no you must put it into words’ he said ‘oh really i could not myself’ ‘do you suppose’ said i constraining myself to be very temperate and quiet with him on account of agnes ‘that i regard miss wickfield otherwise than as a very dear sister’ ‘well master copperfield’ he replied ‘you perceive i am not bound to answer that question you may not you know but then you see you may’ anything to equal the low cunning of his visage and of his shadowless eyes without the ghost of an eyelash i never saw ‘come then’ said i ‘for the sake of miss wickfield’ ‘my agnes’ he exclaimed with a sickly angular contortion of himself ‘would you be so good as call her agnes master copperfield’ ‘for the sake of agnes wickfieldheaven bless her’ ‘thank you for that blessing master copperfield’ he interposed ‘i will tell you what i should under any other circumstances as soon have thought of telling tojack ketch’ ‘to who sir’ said uriah stretching out his neck and shading his ear with his hand ‘to the hangman’ i returned ‘the most unlikely person i could think of’though his own face had suggested the allusion quite as a natural sequence ‘i am engaged to another young lady i hope that contents you’ ‘upon your soul’ said uriah i was about indignantly to give my assertion the confirmation he required when he caught hold of my hand and gave it a squeeze ‘oh master copperfield’ he said ‘if you had only had the condescension to return my confidence when i poured out the fulness of my art the night i put you so much out of the way by sleeping before your sittingroom fire i never should have doubted you as it is i am sure i will take off mother directly and only too appy i know you will excuse the precautions of affection will not you what a pity master copperfield that you did not condescend to return my confidence i am sure i gave you every opportunity but you never have condescended to me as much as i could have wished i know you have never liked me as i have liked you’ all this time he was squeezing my hand with his damp fishy fingers while i made every effort i decently could to get it away but i was quite unsuccessful he drew it under the sleeve of his mulberrycoloured greatcoat and i walked on almost upon compulsion arminarm with him ‘shall we turn’ said uriah by and by wheeling me face about towards the town on which the early moon was now shining silvering the distant windows ‘before we leave the subject you ought to understand’ said i breaking a pretty long silence ‘that i believe agnes wickfield to be as far above you and as far removed from all your aspirations as that moon herself’ ‘peaceful are not she’ said uriah ‘very now confess master copperfield that you have not liked me quite as i have liked you all along you have thought me too umble now i should not wonder’ ‘i am not fond of professions of humility’ i returned ‘or professions of anything else’ ‘there now’ said uriah looking flabby and leadcoloured in the moonlight ‘did not i know it but how little you think of the rightful umbleness of a person in my station master copperfield father and me was both brought up at a foundation school for boys and mother she was likewise brought up at a public sort of charitable establishment they taught us all a deal of umblenessnot much else that i know of from morning to night we was to be umble to this person and umble to that and to pull off our caps here and to make bows there and always to know our place and abase ourselves before our betters and we had such a lot of betters father got the monitormedal by being umble so did i father got made a sexton by being umble he had the character among the gentlefolks of being such a wellbehaved man that they were determined to bring him in “be umble uriah” says father to me “and you will get on it was what was always being dinned into you and me at school it is what goes down best be umble” says father “and you will do” and really it are not done bad’ it was the first time it had ever occurred to me that this detestable cannot of false humility might have originated out of the heep family i had seen the harvest but had never thought of the seed ‘when i was quite a young boy’ said uriah ‘i got to know what umbleness did and i took to it i ate umble pie with an appetite i stopped at the umble point of my learning and says i “hold hard” when you offered to teach me latin i knew better “people like to be above you” says father “keep yourself down” i am very umble to the present moment master copperfield but i have got a little power’ and he said all thisi knew as i saw his face in the moonlightthat i might understand he was resolved to recompense himself by using his power i had never doubted his meanness his craft and malice but i fully comprehended now for the first time what a base unrelenting and revengeful spirit must have been engendered by this early and this long suppression his account of himself was so far attended with an agreeable result that it led to his withdrawing his hand in order that he might have another hug of himself under the chin once apart from him i was determined to keep apart and we walked back side by side saying very little more by the way whether his spirits were elevated by the communication i had made to him or by his having indulged in this retrospect i do not know but they were raised by some influence he talked more at dinner than was usual with him asked his mother off duty from the moment of our reentering the house whether he was not growing too old for a bachelor and once looked at agnes so that i would have given all i had for leave to knock him down when we three males were left alone after dinner he got into a more adventurous state he had taken little or no wine and i presume it was the mere insolence of triumph that was upon him flushed perhaps by the temptation my presence furnished to its exhibition i had observed yesterday that he tried to entice mr wickfield to drink and interpreting the look which agnes had given me as she went out had limited myself to one glass and then proposed that we should follow her i would have done so again today but uriah was too quick for me ‘we seldom see our present visitor sir’ he said addressing mr wickfield sitting such a contrast to him at the end of the table ‘and i should propose to give him welcome in another glass or two of wine if you have no objections mr copperfield your elth and appiness’ i was obliged to make a show of taking the hand he stretched across to me and then with very different emotions i took the hand of the broken gentleman his partner ‘come fellowpartner’ said uriah ‘if i may take the libertynow suppose you give us something or another appropriate to copperfield’ i pass over mr wickfield’s proposing my aunt his proposing mr dick his proposing doctors’ commons his proposing uriah his drinking everything twice his consciousness of his own weakness the ineffectual effort that he made against it the struggle between his shame in uriah’s deportment and his desire to conciliate him the manifest exultation with which uriah twisted and turned and held him up before me it made me sick at heart to see and my hand recoils from writing it ‘come fellowpartner’ said uriah at last ‘i will give you another one and i umbly ask for bumpers seeing i intend to make it the divinest of her sex’ her father had his empty glass in his hand i saw him set it down look at the picture she was so like put his hand to his forehead and shrink back in his elbowchair ‘i am an umble individual to give you her elth’ proceeded uriah ‘but i admireadore her’ no physical pain that her father’s grey head could have borne i think could have been more terrible to me than the mental endurance i saw compressed now within both his hands ‘agnes’ said uriah either not regarding him or not knowing what the nature of his action was ‘agnes wickfield is i am safe to say the divinest of her sex may i speak out among friends to be her father is a proud distinction but to be her usband’ spare me from ever again hearing such a cry as that with which her father rose up from the table ‘what is the matter’ said uriah turning of a deadly colour ‘you are not gone mad after all mr wickfield i hope if i say i have an ambition to make your agnes my agnes i have as good a right to it as another man i have a better right to it than any other man’ i had my arms round mr wickfield imploring him by everything that i could think of oftenest of all by his love for agnes to calm himself a little he was mad for the moment tearing out his hair beating his head trying to force me from him and to force himself from me not answering a word not looking at or seeing anyone blindly striving for he knew not what his face all staring and distorteda frightful spectacle i conjured him incoherently but in the most impassioned manner not to abandon himself to this wildness but to hear me i besought him to think of agnes to connect me with agnes to recollect how agnes and i had grown up together how i honoured her and loved her how she was his pride and joy i tried to bring her idea before him in any form i even reproached him with not having firmness to spare her the knowledge of such a scene as this i may have effected something or his wildness may have spent itself but by degrees he struggled less and began to look at mestrangely at first then with recognition in his eyes at length he said ‘i know trotwood my darling child and youi know but look at him’ he pointed to uriah pale and glowering in a corner evidently very much out in his calculations and taken by surprise ‘look at my torturer’ he replied ‘before him i have step by step abandoned name and reputation peace and quiet house and home’ ‘i have kept your name and reputation for you and your peace and quiet and your house and home too’ said uriah with a sulky hurried defeated air of compromise ‘do not be foolish mr wickfield if i have gone a little beyond what you were prepared for i can go back i suppose there is no harm done’ ‘i looked for single motives in everyone’ said mr wickfield ‘and i was satisfied i had bound him to me by motives of interest but see what he isoh see what he is’ ‘you had better stop him copperfield if you can’ cried uriah with his long forefinger pointing towards me ‘he will say something presentlymind youhe will be sorry to have said afterwards and you will be sorry to have heard’ ‘i will say anything’ cried mr wickfield with a desperate air ‘why should i not be in all the world’s power if i am in yours’ ‘mind i tell you’ said uriah continuing to warn me ‘if you do not stop his mouth you are not his friend why should not you be in all the world’s power mr wickfield because you have got a daughter you and me know what we know do not we let sleeping dogs liewho wants to rouse ‘them i do not cannot you see i am as umble as i can be i tell you if i have gone too far i am sorry what would you have sir’ ‘oh trotwood trotwood’ exclaimed mr wickfield wringing his hands ‘what i have come down to be since i first saw you in this house i was on my downward way then but the dreary dreary road i have traversed since weak indulgence has ruined me indulgence in remembrance and indulgence in forgetfulness my natural grief for my child’s mother turned to disease my natural love for my child turned to disease i have infected everything i touched i have brought misery on what i dearly love i knowyou know i thought it possible that i could truly love one creature in the world and not love the rest i thought it possible that i could truly mourn for one creature gone out of the world and not have some part in the grief of all who mourned thus the lessons of my life have been perverted i have preyed on my own morbid coward heart and it has preyed on me sordid in my grief sordid in my love sordid in my miserable escape from the darker side of both oh see the ruin i am and hate me shun me’ he dropped into a chair and weakly sobbed the excitement into which he had been roused was leaving him uriah came out of his corner ‘i do not know all i have done in my fatuity’ said mr wickfield putting out his hands as if to deprecate my condemnation ‘he knows best’ meaning uriah heep ‘for he has always been at my elbow whispering me you see the millstone that he is about my neck you find him in my house you find him in my business you heard him but a little time ago what need have i to say more’ ‘you have not need to say so much nor half so much nor anything at all’ observed uriah half defiant and half fawning ‘you would not have took it up so if it had not been for the wine you will think better of it tomorrow sir if i have said too much or more than i meant what of it i have not stood by it’ the door opened and agnes gliding in without a vestige of colour in her face put her arm round his neck and steadily said ‘papa you are not well come with me’ he laid his head upon her shoulder as if he were oppressed with heavy shame and went out with her her eyes met mine for but an instant yet i saw how much she knew of what had passed ‘i did not expect he would cut up so rough master copperfield’ said uriah ‘but it is nothing i will be friends with him tomorrow it is for his good i am umbly anxious for his good’ i gave him no answer and went upstairs into the quiet room where agnes had so often sat beside me at my books nobody came near me until late at night i took up a book and tried to read i heard the clocks strike twelve and was still reading without knowing what i read when agnes touched me ‘you will be going early in the morning trotwood let us say goodbye now’ she had been weeping but her face then was so calm and beautiful ‘heaven bless you’ she said giving me her hand ‘dearest agnes’ i returned ‘i see you ask me not to speak of tonightbut is there nothing to be done’ ‘there is god to trust in’ she replied ‘can i do nothingi who come to you with my poor sorrows’ ‘and make mine so much lighter’ she replied ‘dear trotwood no’ ‘dear agnes’ i said ‘it is presumptuous for me who am so poor in all in which you are so richgoodness resolution all noble qualitiesto doubt or direct you but you know how much i love you and how much i owe you you will never sacrifice yourself to a mistaken sense of duty agnes’ more agitated for a moment than i had ever seen her she took her hands from me and moved a step back ‘say you have no such thought dear agnes much more than sister think of the priceless gift of such a heart as yours of such a love as yours’ oh long long afterwards i saw that face rise up before me with its momentary look not wondering not accusing not regretting oh long long afterwards i saw that look subside as it did now into the lovely smile with which she told me she had no fear for herselfi need have none for herand parted from me by the name of brother and was gone it was dark in the morning when i got upon the coach at the inn door the day was just breaking when we were about to start and then as i sat thinking of her came struggling up the coach side through the mingled day and night uriah’s head ‘copperfield’ said he in a croaking whisper as he hung by the iron on the roof ‘i thought you would be glad to hear before you went off that there are no squares broke between us i have been into his room already and we have made it all smooth why though i am umble i am useful to him you know and he understands his interest when he is not in liquor what an agreeable man he is after all master copperfield’ i obliged myself to say that i was glad he had made his apology ‘oh to be sure’ said uriah ‘when a person’s umble you know what is an apology so easy i say i suppose’ with a jerk ‘you have sometimes plucked a pear before it was ripe master copperfield’ ‘i suppose i have’ i replied ‘i did that last night’ said uriah ‘but it will ripen yet it only wants attending to i can wait’ profuse in his farewells he got down again as the coachman got up for anything i know he was eating something to keep the raw morning air out but he made motions with his mouth as if the pear were ripe already and he were smacking his lips over it
