tommy traddles it may have been in consequence of mrs crupp’s advice and perhaps for no better reason than because there was a certain similarity in the sound of the word skittles and traddles that it came into my head next day to go and look after traddles the time he had mentioned was more than out and he lived in a little street near the veterinary college at camden town which was principally tenanted as one of our clerks who lived in that direction informed me by gentlemen students who bought live donkeys and made experiments on those quadrupeds in their private apartments having obtained from this clerk a direction to the academic grove in question i set out the same afternoon to visit my old schoolfellow i found that the street was not as desirable a one as i could have wished it to be for the sake of traddles the inhabitants appeared to have a propensity to throw any little trifles they were not in want of into the road which not only made it rank and sloppy but untidy too on account of the cabbageleaves the refuse was not wholly vegetable either for i myself saw a shoe a doubledup saucepan a black bonnet and an umbrella in various stages of decomposition as i was looking out for the number i wanted the general air of the place reminded me forcibly of the days when i lived with mr and mrs micawber an indescribable character of faded gentility that attached to the house i sought and made it unlike all the other houses in the streetthough they were all built on one monotonous pattern and looked like the early copies of a blundering boy who was learning to make houses and had not yet got out of his cramped brickandmortar pothooksreminded me still more of mr and mrs micawber happening to arrive at the door as it was opened to the afternoon milkman i was reminded of mr and mrs micawber more forcibly yet ‘now’ said the milkman to a very youthful servant girl ‘has that there little bill of mine been heerd on’ ‘oh master says he will attend to it immediate’ was the reply ‘because’ said the milkman going on as if he had received no answer and speaking as i judged from his tone rather for the edification of somebody within the house than of the youthful servantan impression which was strengthened by his manner of glaring down the passage‘because that there little bill has been running so long that i begin to believe it is run away altogether and never will not be heerd of now i am not a going to stand it you know’ said the milkman still throwing his voice into the house and glaring down the passage as to his dealing in the mild article of milk by the by there never was a greater anomaly his deportment would have been fierce in a butcher or a brandymerchant the voice of the youthful servant became faint but she seemed to me from the action of her lips again to murmur that it would be attended to immediate ‘i tell you what’ said the milkman looking hard at her for the first time and taking her by the chin ‘are you fond of milk’ ‘yes i likes it’ she replied ‘good’ said the milkman ‘then you will not have none tomorrow d’ye hear not a fragment of milk you will not have tomorrow’ i thought she seemed upon the whole relieved by the prospect of having any today the milkman after shaking his head at her darkly released her chin and with anything rather than goodwill opened his can and deposited the usual quantity in the family jug this done he went away muttering and uttered the cry of his trade next door in a vindictive shriek ‘does mr traddles live here’ i then inquired a mysterious voice from the end of the passage replied ‘yes’ upon which the youthful servant replied ‘yes’ ‘is he at home’ said i again the mysterious voice replied in the affirmative and again the servant echoed it upon this i walked in and in pursuance of the servant’s directions walked upstairs conscious as i passed the back parlourdoor that i was surveyed by a mysterious eye probably belonging to the mysterious voice when i got to the top of the stairsthe house was only a story high above the ground floortraddles was on the landing to meet me he was delighted to see me and gave me welcome with great heartiness to his little room it was in the front of the house and extremely neat though sparely furnished it was his only room i saw for there was a sofabedstead in it and his blackingbrushes and blacking were among his bookson the top shelf behind a dictionary his table was covered with papers and he was hard at work in an old coat i looked at nothing that i know of but i saw everything even to the prospect of a church upon his china inkstand as i sat downand this too was a faculty confirmed in me in the old micawber times various ingenious arrangements he had made for the disguise of his chest of drawers and the accommodation of his boots his shavingglass and so forth particularly impressed themselves upon me as evidences of the same traddles who used to make models of elephants’ dens in writingpaper to put flies in and to comfort himself under ill usage with the memorable works of art i have so often mentioned in a corner of the room was something neatly covered up with a large white cloth i could not make out what that was ‘traddles’ said i shaking hands with him again after i had sat down ‘i am delighted to see you’ ‘i am delighted to see you copperfield’ he returned ‘i am very glad indeed to see you it was because i was thoroughly glad to see you when we met in ely place and was sure you were thoroughly glad to see me that i gave you this address instead of my address at chambers’ ‘oh you have chambers’ said i ‘why i have the fourth of a room and a passage and the fourth of a clerk’ returned traddles ‘three others and myself unite to have a set of chambersto look businesslikeand we quarter the clerk too halfacrown a week he costs me’ his old simple character and good temper and something of his old unlucky fortune also i thought smiled at me in the smile with which he made this explanation ‘it is not because i have the least pride copperfield you understand’ said traddles ‘that i do not usually give my address here it is only on account of those who come to me who might not like to come here for myself i am fighting my way on in the world against difficulties and it would be ridiculous if i made a pretence of doing anything else’ ‘you are reading for the bar mr waterbrook informed me’ said i ‘why yes’ said traddles rubbing his hands slowly over one another ‘i am reading for the bar the fact is i have just begun to keep my terms after rather a long delay it is some time since i was articled but the payment of that hundred pounds was a great pull a great pull’ said traddles with a wince as if he had had a tooth out ‘do you know what i cannot help thinking of traddles as i sit here looking at you’ i asked him ‘no’ said he ‘that skyblue suit you used to wear’ ‘lord to be sure’ cried traddles laughing ‘tight in the arms and legs you know dear me well those were happy times were not they’ ‘i think our schoolmaster might have made them happier without doing any harm to any of us i acknowledge’ i returned ‘perhaps he might’ said traddles ‘but dear me there was a good deal of fun going on do you remember the nights in the bedroom when we used to have the suppers and when you used to tell the stories ha ha ha and do you remember when i got caned for crying about mr mell old creakle i should like to see him again too’ ‘he was a brute to you traddles’ said i indignantly for his good humour made me feel as if i had seen him beaten but yesterday ‘do you think so’ returned traddles ‘really perhaps he was rather but it is all over a long while old creakle’ ‘you were brought up by an uncle then’ said i ‘of course i was’ said traddles ‘the one i was always going to write to and always did not eh ha ha ha yes i had an uncle then he died soon after i left school’ ‘indeed’ ‘yes he was a retiredwhat do you call itdraperclothmerchantand had made me his heir but he did not like me when i grew up’ ‘do you really mean that’ said i he was so composed that i fancied he must have some other meaning ‘oh dear yes copperfield i mean it’ replied traddles ‘it was an unfortunate thing but he did not like me at all he said i was not at all what he expected and so he married his housekeeper’ ‘and what did you do’ i asked ‘i did not do anything in particular’ said traddles ‘i lived with them waiting to be put out in the world until his gout unfortunately flew to his stomachand so he died and so she married a young man and so i was not provided for’ ‘did you get nothing traddles after all’ ‘oh dear yes’ said traddles ‘i got fifty pounds i had never been brought up to any profession and at first i was at a loss what to do for myself however i began with the assistance of the son of a professional man who had been to salem houseyawler with his nose on one side do you recollect him’ no he had not been there with me all the noses were straight in my day ‘it do not matter’ said traddles ‘i began by means of his assistance to copy law writings that did not answer very well and then i began to state cases for them and make abstracts and that sort of work for i am a plodding kind of fellow copperfield and had learnt the way of doing such things pithily well that put it in my head to enter myself as a law student and that ran away with all that was left of the fifty pounds yawler recommended me to one or two other offices howevermr waterbrook’s for oneand i got a good many jobs i was fortunate enough too to become acquainted with a person in the publishing way who was getting up an encyclopaedia and he set me to work and indeed’ glancing at his table ‘i am at work for him at this minute i am not a bad compiler copperfield’ said traddles preserving the same air of cheerful confidence in all he said ‘but i have no invention at all not a particle i suppose there never was a young man with less originality than i have’ as traddles seemed to expect that i should assent to this as a matter of course i nodded and he went on with the same sprightly patiencei can find no better expressionas before ‘so by little and little and not living high i managed to scrape up the hundred pounds at last’ said traddles ‘and thank heaven that is paidthough it wasthough it certainly was’ said traddles wincing again as if he had had another tooth out ‘a pull i am living by the sort of work i have mentioned still and i hope one of these days to get connected with some newspaper which would almost be the making of my fortune now copperfield you are so exactly what you used to be with that agreeable face and it is so pleasant to see you that i shall not conceal anything therefore you must know that i am engaged’ engaged oh dora ‘she is a curate’s daughter’ said traddles ‘one of ten down in devonshire yes’ for he saw me glance involuntarily at the prospect on the inkstand ‘that is the church you come round here to the left out of this gate’ tracing his finger along the inkstand ‘and exactly where i hold this pen there stands the housefacing you understand towards the church’ the delight with which he entered into these particulars did not fully present itself to me until afterwards for my selfish thoughts were making a groundplan of mr spenlow’s house and garden at the same moment ‘she is such a dear girl’ said traddles ‘a little older than me but the dearest girl i told you i was going out of town i have been down there i walked there and i walked back and i had the most delightful time i dare say ours is likely to be a rather long engagement but our motto is “wait and hope” we always say that “wait and hope” we always say and she would wait copperfield till she was sixtyany age you can mentionfor me’ traddles rose from his chair and with a triumphant smile put his hand upon the white cloth i had observed ‘however’ he said ‘it is not that we have not made a beginning towards housekeeping no no we have begun we must get on by degrees but we have begun here’ drawing the cloth off with great pride and care ‘are two pieces of furniture to commence with this flowerpot and stand she bought herself you put that in a parlour window’ said traddles falling a little back from it to survey it with the greater admiration ‘with a plant in it andand there you are this little round table with the marble top it is two feet ten in circumference i bought you want to lay a book down you know or somebody comes to see you or your wife and wants a place to stand a cup of tea upon andand there you are again’ said traddles ‘it is an admirable piece of workmanshipfirm as a rock’ i praised them both highly and traddles replaced the covering as carefully as he had removed it ‘it is not a great deal towards the furnishing’ said traddles ‘but it is something the tablecloths and pillowcases and articles of that kind are what discourage me most copperfield so does the ironmongerycandleboxes and gridirons and that sort of necessariesbecause those things tell and mount up however “wait and hope” and i assure you she is the dearest girl’ ‘i am quite certain of it’ said i ‘in the meantime’ said traddles coming back to his chair ‘and this is the end of my prosing about myself i get on as well as i can i do not make much but i do not spend much in general i board with the people downstairs who are very agreeable people indeed both mr and mrs micawber have seen a good deal of life and are excellent company’ ‘my dear traddles’ i quickly exclaimed ‘what are you talking about’ traddles looked at me as if he wondered what i was talking about ‘mr and mrs micawber’ i repeated ‘why i am intimately acquainted with them’ an opportune double knock at the door which i knew well from old experience in windsor terrace and which nobody but mr micawber could ever have knocked at that door resolved any doubt in my mind as to their being my old friends i begged traddles to ask his landlord to walk up traddles accordingly did so over the banister and mr micawber not a bit changedhis tights his stick his shirtcollar and his eyeglass all the same as evercame into the room with a genteel and youthful air ‘i beg your pardon mr traddles’ said mr micawber with the old roll in his voice as he checked himself in humming a soft tune ‘i was not aware that there was any individual alien to this tenement in your sanctum’ mr micawber slightly bowed to me and pulled up his shirtcollar ‘how do you do mr micawber’ said i ‘sir’ said mr micawber ‘you are exceedingly obliging i am in statu quo’ ‘and mrs micawber’ i pursued ‘sir’ said mr micawber ‘she is also thank god in statu quo’ ‘and the children mr micawber’ ‘sir’ said mr micawber ‘i rejoice to reply that they are likewise in the enjoyment of salubrity’ all this time mr micawber had not known me in the least though he had stood face to face with me but now seeing me smile he examined my features with more attention fell back cried ‘is it possible have i the pleasure of again beholding copperfield’ and shook me by both hands with the utmost fervour ‘good heaven mr traddles’ said mr micawber ‘to think that i should find you acquainted with the friend of my youth the companion of earlier days my dear’ calling over the banisters to mrs micawber while traddles looked with reason not a little amazed at this description of me ‘here is a gentleman in mr traddles’s apartment whom he wishes to have the pleasure of presenting to you my love’ mr micawber immediately reappeared and shook hands with me again ‘and how is our good friend the doctor copperfield’ said mr micawber ‘and all the circle at canterbury’ ‘i have none but good accounts of them’ said i ‘i am most delighted to hear it’ said mr micawber ‘it was at canterbury where we last met within the shadow i may figuratively say of that religious edifice immortalized by chaucer which was anciently the resort of pilgrims from the remotest corners ofin short’ said mr micawber ‘in the immediate neighbourhood of the cathedral’ i replied that it was mr micawber continued talking as volubly as he could but not i thought without showing by some marks of concern in his countenance that he was sensible of sounds in the next room as of mrs micawber washing her hands and hurriedly opening and shutting drawers that were uneasy in their action ‘you find us copperfield’ said mr micawber with one eye on traddles ‘at present established on what may be designated as a small and unassuming scale but you are aware that i have in the course of my career surmounted difficulties and conquered obstacles you are no stranger to the fact that there have been periods of my life when it has been requisite that i should pause until certain expected events should turn up when it has been necessary that i should fall back before making what i trust i shall not be accused of presumption in terminga spring the present is one of those momentous stages in the life of man you find me fallen back for a spring and i have every reason to believe that a vigorous leap will shortly be the result’ i was expressing my satisfaction when mrs micawber came in a little more slatternly than she used to be or so she seemed now to my unaccustomed eyes but still with some preparation of herself for company and with a pair of brown gloves on ‘my dear’ said mr micawber leading her towards me ‘here is a gentleman of the name of copperfield who wishes to renew his acquaintance with you’ it would have been better as it turned out to have led gently up to this announcement for mrs micawber being in a delicate state of health was overcome by it and was taken so unwell that mr micawber was obliged in great trepidation to run down to the waterbutt in the backyard and draw a basinful to lave her brow with she presently revived however and was really pleased to see me we had halfanhour’s talk all together and i asked her about the twins who she said were ‘grown great creatures’ and after master and miss micawber whom she described as ‘absolute giants’ but they were not produced on that occasion mr micawber was very anxious that i should stay to dinner i should not have been averse to do so but that i imagined i detected trouble and calculation relative to the extent of the cold meat in mrs micawber’s eye i therefore pleaded another engagement and observing that mrs micawber’s spirits were immediately lightened i resisted all persuasion to forego it but i told traddles and mr and mrs micawber that before i could think of leaving they must appoint a day when they would come and dine with me the occupations to which traddles stood pledged rendered it necessary to fix a somewhat distant one but an appointment was made for the purpose that suited us all and then i took my leave mr micawber under pretence of showing me a nearer way than that by which i had come accompanied me to the corner of the street being anxious he explained to me to say a few words to an old friend in confidence ‘my dear copperfield’ said mr micawber ‘i need hardly tell you that to have beneath our roof under existing circumstances a mind like that which gleamsif i may be allowed the expressionwhich gleamsin your friend traddles is an unspeakable comfort with a washerwoman who exposes hardbake for sale in her parlourwindow dwelling next door and a bowstreet officer residing over the way you may imagine that his society is a source of consolation to myself and to mrs micawber i am at present my dear copperfield engaged in the sale of corn upon commission it is not an avocation of a remunerative descriptionin other words it does not payand some temporary embarrassments of a pecuniary nature have been the consequence i am however delighted to add that i have now an immediate prospect of something turning up i am not at liberty to say in what direction which i trust will enable me to provide permanently both for myself and for your friend traddles in whom i have an unaffected interest you may perhaps be prepared to hear that mrs micawber is in a state of health which renders it not wholly improbable that an addition may be ultimately made to those pledges of affection whichin short to the infantine group mrs micawber’s family have been so good as to express their dissatisfaction at this state of things i have merely to observe that i am not aware that it is any business of theirs and that i repel that exhibition of feeling with scorn and with defiance’ mr micawber then shook hands with me again and left me
