somebody turns up it has not occurred to me to mention peggotty since i ran away but of course i wrote her a letter almost as soon as i was housed at dover and another and a longer letter containing all particulars fully related when my aunt took me formally under her protection on my being settled at doctor strong’s i wrote to her again detailing my happy condition and prospects i never could have derived anything like the pleasure from spending the money mr dick had given me that i felt in sending a gold halfguinea to peggotty per post enclosed in this last letter to discharge the sum i had borrowed of her in which epistle not before i mentioned about the young man with the donkeycart to these communications peggotty replied as promptly if not as concisely as a merchant’s clerk her utmost powers of expression which were certainly not great in ink were exhausted in the attempt to write what she felt on the subject of my journey four sides of incoherent and interjectional beginnings of sentences that had no end except blots were inadequate to afford her any relief but the blots were more expressive to me than the best composition for they showed me that peggotty had been crying all over the paper and what could i have desired more i made out without much difficulty that she could not take quite kindly to my aunt yet the notice was too short after so long a prepossession the other way we never knew a person she wrote but to think that miss betsey should seem to be so different from what she had been thought to be was a moralthat was her word she was evidently still afraid of miss betsey for she sent her grateful duty to her but timidly and she was evidently afraid of me too and entertained the probability of my running away again soon if i might judge from the repeated hints she threw out that the coachfare to yarmouth was always to be had of her for the asking she gave me one piece of intelligence which affected me very much namely that there had been a sale of the furniture at our old home and that mr and miss murdstone were gone away and the house was shut up to be let or sold god knows i had no part in it while they remained there but it pained me to think of the dear old place as altogether abandoned of the weeds growing tall in the garden and the fallen leaves lying thick and wet upon the paths i imagined how the winds of winter would howl round it how the cold rain would beat upon the windowglass how the moon would make ghosts on the walls of the empty rooms watching their solitude all night i thought afresh of the grave in the churchyard underneath the tree and it seemed as if the house were dead too now and all connected with my father and mother were faded away there was no other news in peggotty’s letters mr barkis was an excellent husband she said though still a little near but we all had our faults and she had plenty though i am sure i do not know what they were and he sent his duty and my little bedroom was always ready for me mr peggotty was well and ham was well and mrs gummidge was but poorly and little them’ly would not send her love but said that peggotty might send it if she liked all this intelligence i dutifully imparted to my aunt only reserving to myself the mention of little them’ly to whom i instinctively felt that she would not very tenderly incline while i was yet new at doctor strong’s she made several excursions over to canterbury to see me and always at unseasonable hours with the view i suppose of taking me by surprise but finding me well employed and bearing a good character and hearing on all hands that i rose fast in the school she soon discontinued these visits i saw her on a saturday every third or fourth week when i went over to dover for a treat and i saw mr dick every alternate wednesday when he arrived by stagecoach at noon to stay until next morning on these occasions mr dick never travelled without a leathern writingdesk containing a supply of stationery and the memorial in relation to which document he had a notion that time was beginning to press now and that it really must be got out of hand mr dick was very partial to gingerbread to render his visits the more agreeable my aunt had instructed me to open a credit for him at a cake shop which was hampered with the stipulation that he should not be served with more than one shilling’sworth in the course of any one day this and the reference of all his little bills at the county inn where he slept to my aunt before they were paid induced me to suspect that he was only allowed to rattle his money and not to spend it i found on further investigation that this was so or at least there was an agreement between him and my aunt that he should account to her for all his disbursements as he had no idea of deceiving her and always desired to please her he was thus made chary of launching into expense on this point as well as on all other possible points mr dick was convinced that my aunt was the wisest and most wonderful of women as he repeatedly told me with infinite secrecy and always in a whisper ‘trotwood’ said mr dick with an air of mystery after imparting this confidence to me one wednesday ‘who is the man that hides near our house and frightens her’ ‘frightens my aunt sir’ mr dick nodded ‘i thought nothing would have frightened her’ he said ‘for she is’ here he whispered softly ‘do not mention itthe wisest and most wonderful of women’ having said which he drew back to observe the effect which this description of her made upon me ‘the first time he came’ said mr dick ‘waslet me seesixteen hundred and fortynine was the date of king charles’s execution i think you said sixteen hundred and fortynine’ ‘yes sir’ ‘i do not know how it can be’ said mr dick sorely puzzled and shaking his head ‘i do not think i am as old as that’ ‘was it in that year that the man appeared sir’ i asked ‘why really’ said mr dick ‘i do not see how it can have been in that year trotwood did you get that date out of history’ ‘yes sir’ ‘i suppose history never lies does it’ said mr dick with a gleam of hope ‘oh dear no sir’ i replied most decisively i was ingenuous and young and i thought so ‘i cannot make it out’ said mr dick shaking his head ‘there is something wrong somewhere however it was very soon after the mistake was made of putting some of the trouble out of king charles’s head into my head that the man first came i was walking out with miss trotwood after tea just at dark and there he was close to our house’ ‘walking about’ i inquired ‘walking about’ repeated mr dick ‘let me see i must recollect a bit nno no he was not walking about’ i asked as the shortest way to get at it what he was doing ‘well he was not there at all’ said mr dick ‘until he came up behind her and whispered then she turned round and fainted and i stood still and looked at him and he walked away but that he should have been hiding ever since in the ground or somewhere is the most extraordinary thing’ ‘has he been hiding ever since’ i asked ‘to be sure he has’ retorted mr dick nodding his head gravely ‘never came out till last night we were walking last night and he came up behind her again and i knew him again’ ‘and did he frighten my aunt again’ ‘all of a shiver’ said mr dick counterfeiting that affection and making his teeth chatter ‘held by the palings cried but trotwood come here’ getting me close to him that he might whisper very softly ‘why did she give him money boy in the moonlight’ ‘he was a beggar perhaps’ mr dick shook his head as utterly renouncing the suggestion and having replied a great many times and with great confidence ‘no beggar no beggar no beggar sir’ went on to say that from his window he had afterwards and late at night seen my aunt give this person money outside the garden rails in the moonlight who then slunk awayinto the ground again as he thought probableand was seen no more while my aunt came hurriedly and secretly back into the house and had even that morning been quite different from her usual self which preyed on mr dick’s mind i had not the least belief in the outset of this story that the unknown was anything but a delusion of mr dick’s and one of the line of that illfated prince who occasioned him so much difficulty but after some reflection i began to entertain the question whether an attempt or threat of an attempt might have been twice made to take poor mr dick himself from under my aunt’s protection and whether my aunt the strength of whose kind feeling towards him i knew from herself might have been induced to pay a price for his peace and quiet as i was already much attached to mr dick and very solicitous for his welfare my fears favoured this supposition and for a long time his wednesday hardly ever came round without my entertaining a misgiving that he would not be on the coachbox as usual there he always appeared however greyheaded laughing and happy and he never had anything more to tell of the man who could frighten my aunt these wednesdays were the happiest days of mr dick’s life they were far from being the least happy of mine he soon became known to every boy in the school and though he never took an active part in any game but kiteflying was as deeply interested in all our sports as anyone among us how often have i seen him intent upon a match at marbles or pegtop looking on with a face of unutterable interest and hardly breathing at the critical times how often at hare and hounds have i seen him mounted on a little knoll cheering the whole field on to action and waving his hat above his grey head oblivious of king charles the martyr’s head and all belonging to it how many a summer hour have i known to be but blissful minutes to him in the cricketfield how many winter days have i seen him standing bluenosed in the snow and east wind looking at the boys going down the long slide and clapping his worsted gloves in rapture he was an universal favourite and his ingenuity in little things was transcendent he could cut oranges into such devices as none of us had an idea of he could make a boat out of anything from a skewer upwards he could turn crampbones into chessmen fashion roman chariots from old court cards make spoked wheels out of cotton reels and birdcages of old wire but he was greatest of all perhaps in the articles of string and straw with which we were all persuaded he could do anything that could be done by hands mr dick’s renown was not long confined to us after a few wednesdays doctor strong himself made some inquiries of me about him and i told him all my aunt had told me which interested the doctor so much that he requested on the occasion of his next visit to be presented to him this ceremony i performed and the doctor begging mr dick whensoever he should not find me at the coach office to come on there and rest himself until our morning’s work was over it soon passed into a custom for mr dick to come on as a matter of course and if we were a little late as often happened on a wednesday to walk about the courtyard waiting for me here he made the acquaintance of the doctor’s beautiful young wife paler than formerly all this time more rarely seen by me or anyone i think and not so gay but not less beautiful and so became more and more familiar by degrees until at last he would come into the school and wait he always sat in a particular corner on a particular stool which was called ‘dick’ after him here he would sit with his grey head bent forward attentively listening to whatever might be going on with a profound veneration for the learning he had never been able to acquire this veneration mr dick extended to the doctor whom he thought the most subtle and accomplished philosopher of any age it was long before mr dick ever spoke to him otherwise than bareheaded and even when he and the doctor had struck up quite a friendship and would walk together by the hour on that side of the courtyard which was known among us as the doctor’s walk mr dick would pull off his hat at intervals to show his respect for wisdom and knowledge how it ever came about that the doctor began to read out scraps of the famous dictionary in these walks i never knew perhaps he felt it all the same at first as reading to himself however it passed into a custom too and mr dick listening with a face shining with pride and pleasure in his heart of hearts believed the dictionary to be the most delightful book in the world as i think of them going up and down before those schoolroom windowsthe doctor reading with his complacent smile an occasional flourish of the manuscript or grave motion of his head and mr dick listening enchained by interest with his poor wits calmly wandering god knows where upon the wings of hard wordsi think of it as one of the pleasantest things in a quiet way that i have ever seen i feel as if they might go walking to and fro for ever and the world might somehow be the better for itas if a thousand things it makes a noise about were not one half so good for it or me agnes was one of mr dick’s friends very soon and in often coming to the house he made acquaintance with uriah the friendship between himself and me increased continually and it was maintained on this odd footing that while mr dick came professedly to look after me as my guardian he always consulted me in any little matter of doubt that arose and invariably guided himself by my advice not only having a high respect for my native sagacity but considering that i inherited a good deal from my aunt one thursday morning when i was about to walk with mr dick from the hotel to the coach office before going back to school for we had an hour’s school before breakfast i met uriah in the street who reminded me of the promise i had made to take tea with himself and his mother adding with a writhe ‘but i did not expect you to keep it master copperfield we are so very umble’ i really had not yet been able to make up my mind whether i liked uriah or detested him and i was very doubtful about it still as i stood looking him in the face in the street but i felt it quite an affront to be supposed proud and said i only wanted to be asked ‘oh if that is all master copperfield’ said uriah ‘and it really is not our umbleness that prevents you will you come this evening but if it is our umbleness i hope you will not mind owning to it master copperfield for we are well aware of our condition’ i said i would mention it to mr wickfield and if he approved as i had no doubt he would i would come with pleasure so at six of the clock that evening which was one of the early office evenings i announced myself as ready to uriah ‘mother will be proud indeed’ he said as we walked away together ‘or she would be proud if it was not sinful master copperfield’ ‘yet you did not mind supposing i was proud this morning’ i returned ‘oh dear no master copperfield’ returned uriah ‘oh believe me no such a thought never came into my head i should not have deemed it at all proud if you had thought us too umble for you because we are so very umble’ ‘have you been studying much law lately’ i asked to change the subject ‘oh master copperfield’ he said with an air of selfdenial ‘my reading is hardly to be called study i have passed an hour or two in the evening sometimes with mr tidd’ ‘rather hard i suppose’ said i ‘he is hard to me sometimes’ returned uriah ‘but i do not know what he might be to a gifted person’ after beating a little tune on his chin as he walked on with the two forefingers of his skeleton right hand he added ‘there are expressions you see master copperfieldlatin words and termsin mr tidd that are trying to a reader of my umble attainments’ ‘would you like to be taught latin’ i said briskly ‘i will teach it you with pleasure as i learn it’ ‘oh thank you master copperfield’ he answered shaking his head ‘i am sure it is very kind of you to make the offer but i am much too umble to accept it’ ‘what nonsense uriah’ ‘oh indeed you must excuse me master copperfield i am greatly obliged and i should like it of all things i assure you but i am far too umble there are people enough to tread upon me in my lowly state without my doing outrage to their feelings by possessing learning learning are not for me a person like myself had better not aspire if he is to get on in life he must get on umbly master copperfield’ i never saw his mouth so wide or the creases in his cheeks so deep as when he delivered himself of these sentiments shaking his head all the time and writhing modestly ‘i think you are wrong uriah’ i said ‘i dare say there are several things that i could teach you if you would like to learn them’ ‘oh i do not doubt that master copperfield’ he answered ‘not in the least but not being umble yourself you do not judge well perhaps for them that are i will not provoke my betters with knowledge thank you i am much too umble here is my umble dwelling master copperfield’ we entered a low oldfashioned room walked straight into from the street and found there mrs heep who was the dead image of uriah only short she received me with the utmost humility and apologized to me for giving her son a kiss observing that lowly as they were they had their natural affections which they hoped would give no offence to anyone it was a perfectly decent room half parlour and half kitchen but not at all a snug room the teathings were set upon the table and the kettle was boiling on the hob there was a chest of drawers with an escritoire top for uriah to read or write at of an evening there was uriah’s blue bag lying down and vomiting papers there was a company of uriah’s books commanded by mr tidd there was a corner cupboard and there were the usual articles of furniture i do not remember that any individual object had a bare pinched spare look but i do remember that the whole place had it was perhaps a part of mrs heep’s humility that she still wore weeds notwithstanding the lapse of time that had occurred since mr heep’s decease she still wore weeds i think there was some compromise in the cap but otherwise she was as weedy as in the early days of her mourning ‘this is a day to be remembered my uriah i am sure’ said mrs heep making the tea ‘when master copperfield pays us a visit’ ‘i said you would think so mother’ said uriah ‘if i could have wished father to remain among us for any reason’ said mrs heep ‘it would have been that he might have known his company this afternoon’ i felt embarrassed by these compliments but i was sensible too of being entertained as an honoured guest and i thought mrs heep an agreeable woman ‘my uriah’ said mrs heep ‘has looked forward to this sir a long while he had his fears that our umbleness stood in the way and i joined in them myself umble we are umble we have been umble we shall ever be’ said mrs heep ‘i am sure you have no occasion to be so madam’ i said ‘unless you like’ ‘thank you sir’ retorted mrs heep ‘we know our station and are thankful in it’ i found that mrs heep gradually got nearer to me and that uriah gradually got opposite to me and that they respectfully plied me with the choicest of the eatables on the table there was nothing particularly choice there to be sure but i took the will for the deed and felt that they were very attentive presently they began to talk about aunts and then i told them about mine and about fathers and mothers and then i told them about mine and then mrs heep began to talk about fathersinlaw and then i began to tell her about minebut stopped because my aunt had advised me to observe a silence on that subject a tender young cork however would have had no more chance against a pair of corkscrews or a tender young tooth against a pair of dentists or a little shuttlecock against two battledores than i had against uriah and mrs heep they did just what they liked with me and wormed things out of me that i had no desire to tell with a certainty i blush to think of the more especially as in my juvenile frankness i took some credit to myself for being so confidential and felt that i was quite the patron of my two respectful entertainers they were very fond of one another that was certain i take it that had its effect upon me as a touch of nature but the skill with which the one followed up whatever the other said was a touch of art which i was still less proof against when there was nothing more to be got out of me about myself for on the murdstone and grinby life and on my journey i was dumb they began about mr wickfield and agnes uriah threw the ball to mrs heep mrs heep caught it and threw it back to uriah uriah kept it up a little while then sent it back to mrs heep and so they went on tossing it about until i had no idea who had got it and was quite bewildered the ball itself was always changing too now it was mr wickfield now agnes now the excellence of mr wickfield now my admiration of agnes now the extent of mr wickfield’s business and resources now our domestic life after dinner now the wine that mr wickfield took the reason why he took it and the pity that it was he took so much now one thing now another then everything at once and all the time without appearing to speak very often or to do anything but sometimes encourage them a little for fear they should be overcome by their humility and the honour of my company i found myself perpetually letting out something or other that i had no business to let out and seeing the effect of it in the twinkling of uriah’s dinted nostrils i had begun to be a little uncomfortable and to wish myself well out of the visit when a figure coming down the street passed the doorit stood open to air the room which was warm the weather being close for the time of yearcame back again looked in and walked in exclaiming loudly ‘copperfield is it possible’ it was mr micawber it was mr micawber with his eyeglass and his walkingstick and his shirtcollar and his genteel air and the condescending roll in his voice all complete ‘my dear copperfield’ said mr micawber putting out his hand ‘this is indeed a meeting which is calculated to impress the mind with a sense of the instability and uncertainty of all humanin short it is a most extraordinary meeting walking along the street reflecting upon the probability of something turning up of which i am at present rather sanguine i find a young but valued friend turn up who is connected with the most eventful period of my life i may say with the turningpoint of my existence copperfield my dear fellow how do you do’ i cannot sayi really cannot saythat i was glad to see mr micawber there but i was glad to see him too and shook hands with him heartily inquiring how mrs micawber was ‘thank you’ said mr micawber waving his hand as of old and settling his chin in his shirtcollar ‘she is tolerably convalescent the twins no longer derive their sustenance from nature’s fountsin short’ said mr micawber in one of his bursts of confidence ‘they are weanedand mrs micawber is at present my travelling companion she will be rejoiced copperfield to renew her acquaintance with one who has proved himself in all respects a worthy minister at the sacred altar of friendship’ i said i should be delighted to see her ‘you are very good’ said mr micawber mr micawber then smiled settled his chin again and looked about him ‘i have discovered my friend copperfield’ said mr micawber genteelly and without addressing himself particularly to anyone ‘not in solitude but partaking of a social meal in company with a widow lady and one who is apparently her offspringin short’ said mr micawber in another of his bursts of confidence ‘her son i shall esteem it an honour to be presented’ i could do no less under these circumstances than make mr micawber known to uriah heep and his mother which i accordingly did as they abased themselves before him mr micawber took a seat and waved his hand in his most courtly manner ‘any friend of my friend copperfield’s’ said mr micawber ‘has a personal claim upon myself’ ‘we are too umble sir’ said mrs heep ‘my son and me to be the friends of master copperfield he has been so good as take his tea with us and we are thankful to him for his company also to you sir for your notice’ ‘madam’ returned mr micawber with a bow ‘you are very obliging and what are you doing copperfield still in the wine trade’ i was excessively anxious to get mr micawber away and replied with my hat in my hand and a very red face i have no doubt that i was a pupil at doctor strong’s ‘a pupil’ said mr micawber raising his eyebrows ‘i am extremely happy to hear it although a mind like my friend copperfield’s’to uriah and mrs heep‘does not require that cultivation which without his knowledge of men and things it would require still it is a rich soil teeming with latent vegetationin short’ said mr micawber smiling in another burst of confidence ‘it is an intellect capable of getting up the classics to any extent’ uriah with his long hands slowly twining over one another made a ghastly writhe from the waist upwards to express his concurrence in this estimation of me ‘shall we go and see mrs micawber sir’ i said to get mr micawber away ‘if you will do her that favour copperfield’ replied mr micawber rising ‘i have no scruple in saying in the presence of our friends here that i am a man who has for some years contended against the pressure of pecuniary difficulties’ i knew he was certain to say something of this kind he always would be so boastful about his difficulties ‘sometimes i have risen superior to my difficulties sometimes my difficulties havein short have floored me there have been times when i have administered a succession of facers to them there have been times when they have been too many for me and i have given in and said to mrs micawber in the words of cato “plato thou reasonest well it is all up now i can show fight no more” but at no time of my life’ said mr micawber ‘have i enjoyed a higher degree of satisfaction than in pouring my griefs if i may describe difficulties chiefly arising out of warrants of attorney and promissory notes at two and four months by that word into the bosom of my friend copperfield’ mr micawber closed this handsome tribute by saying ‘mr heep good evening mrs heep your servant’ and then walking out with me in his most fashionable manner making a good deal of noise on the pavement with his shoes and humming a tune as we went it was a little inn where mr micawber put up and he occupied a little room in it partitioned off from the commercial room and strongly flavoured with tobaccosmoke i think it was over the kitchen because a warm greasy smell appeared to come up through the chinks in the floor and there was a flabby perspiration on the walls i know it was near the bar on account of the smell of spirits and jingling of glasses here recumbent on a small sofa underneath a picture of a racehorse with her head close to the fire and her feet pushing the mustard off the dumbwaiter at the other end of the room was mrs micawber to whom mr micawber entered first saying ‘my dear allow me to introduce to you a pupil of doctor strong’s’ i noticed by the by that although mr micawber was just as much confused as ever about my age and standing he always remembered as a genteel thing that i was a pupil of doctor strong’s mrs micawber was amazed but very glad to see me i was very glad to see her too and after an affectionate greeting on both sides sat down on the small sofa near her ‘my dear’ said mr micawber ‘if you will mention to copperfield what our present position is which i have no doubt he will like to know i will go and look at the paper the while and see whether anything turns up among the advertisements’ ‘i thought you were at plymouth madam’ i said to mrs micawber as he went out ‘my dear master copperfield’ she replied ‘we went to plymouth’ ‘to be on the spot’ i hinted ‘just so’ said mrs micawber ‘to be on the spot but the truth is talent is not wanted in the custom house the local influence of my family was quite unavailing to obtain any employment in that department for a man of mr micawber’s abilities they would rather not have a man of mr micawber’s abilities he would only show the deficiency of the others apart from which’ said mrs micawber ‘i will not disguise from you my dear master copperfield that when that branch of my family which is settled in plymouth became aware that mr micawber was accompanied by myself and by little wilkins and his sister and by the twins they did not receive him with that ardour which he might have expected being so newly released from captivity in fact’ said mrs micawber lowering her voice‘this is between ourselvesour reception was cool’ ‘dear me’ i said ‘yes’ said mrs micawber ‘it is truly painful to contemplate mankind in such an aspect master copperfield but our reception was decidedly cool there is no doubt about it in fact that branch of my family which is settled in plymouth became quite personal to mr micawber before we had been there a week’ i said and thought that they ought to be ashamed of themselves ‘still so it was’ continued mrs micawber ‘under such circumstances what could a man of mr micawber’s spirit do but one obvious course was left to borrow of that branch of my family the money to return to london and to return at any sacrifice’ ‘then you all came back again madam’ i said ‘we all came back again’ replied mrs micawber ‘since then i have consulted other branches of my family on the course which it is most expedient for mr micawber to takefor i maintain that he must take some course master copperfield’ said mrs micawber argumentatively ‘it is clear that a family of six not including a domestic cannot live upon air’ ‘certainly madam’ said i ‘the opinion of those other branches of my family’ pursued mrs micawber ‘is that mr micawber should immediately turn his attention to coals’ ‘to what madam’ ‘to coals’ said mrs micawber ‘to the coal trade mr micawber was induced to think on inquiry that there might be an opening for a man of his talent in the medway coal trade then as mr micawber very properly said the first step to be taken clearly was to come and see the medway which we came and saw i say “we” master copperfield for i never will’ said mrs micawber with emotion ‘i never will desert mr micawber’ i murmured my admiration and approbation ‘we came’ repeated mrs micawber ‘and saw the medway my opinion of the coal trade on that river is that it may require talent but that it certainly requires capital talent mr micawber has capital mr micawber has not we saw i think the greater part of the medway and that is my individual conclusion being so near here mr micawber was of opinion that it would be rash not to come on and see the cathedral firstly on account of its being so well worth seeing and our never having seen it and secondly on account of the great probability of something turning up in a cathedral town we have been here’ said mrs micawber ‘three days nothing has as yet turned up and it may not surprise you my dear master copperfield so much as it would a stranger to know that we are at present waiting for a remittance from london to discharge our pecuniary obligations at this hotel until the arrival of that remittance’ said mrs micawber with much feeling ‘i am cut off from my home i allude to lodgings in pentonville from my boy and girl and from my twins’ i felt the utmost sympathy for mr and mrs micawber in this anxious extremity and said as much to mr micawber who now returned adding that i only wished i had money enough to lend them the amount they needed mr micawber’s answer expressed the disturbance of his mind he said shaking hands with me ‘copperfield you are a true friend but when the worst comes to the worst no man is without a friend who is possessed of shaving materials’ at this dreadful hint mrs micawber threw her arms round mr micawber’s neck and entreated him to be calm he wept but so far recovered almost immediately as to ring the bell for the waiter and bespeak a hot kidney pudding and a plate of shrimps for breakfast in the morning when i took my leave of them they both pressed me so much to come and dine before they went away that i could not refuse but as i knew i could not come next day when i should have a good deal to prepare in the evening mr micawber arranged that he would call at doctor strong’s in the course of the morning having a presentiment that the remittance would arrive by that post and propose the day after if it would suit me better accordingly i was called out of school next forenoon and found mr micawber in the parlour who had called to say that the dinner would take place as proposed when i asked him if the remittance had come he pressed my hand and departed as i was looking out of window that same evening it surprised me and made me rather uneasy to see mr micawber and uriah heep walk past arm in arm uriah humbly sensible of the honour that was done him and mr micawber taking a bland delight in extending his patronage to uriah but i was still more surprised when i went to the little hotel next day at the appointed dinnerhour which was four of the clock to find from what mr micawber said that he had gone home with uriah and had drunk brandyandwater at mrs heep’s ‘and i will tell you what my dear copperfield’ said mr micawber ‘your friend heep is a young fellow who might be attorneygeneral if i had known that young man at the period when my difficulties came to a crisis all i can say is that i believe my creditors would have been a great deal better managed than they were’ i hardly understood how this could have been seeing that mr micawber had paid them nothing at all as it was but i did not like to ask neither did i like to say that i hoped he had not been too communicative to uriah or to inquire if they had talked much about me i was afraid of hurting mr micawber’s feelings or at all events mrs micawber’s she being very sensitive but i was uncomfortable about it too and often thought about it afterwards we had a beautiful little dinner quite an elegant dish of fish the kidneyend of a loin of veal roasted fried sausagemeat a partridge and a pudding there was wine and there was strong ale and after dinner mrs micawber made us a bowl of hot punch with her own hands mr micawber was uncommonly convivial i never saw him such good company he made his face shine with the punch so that it looked as if it had been varnished all over he got cheerfully sentimental about the town and proposed success to it observing that mrs micawber and himself had been made extremely snug and comfortable there and that he never should forget the agreeable hours they had passed in canterbury he proposed me afterwards and he and mrs micawber and i took a review of our past acquaintance in the course of which we sold the property all over again then i proposed mrs micawber or at least said modestly ‘if you will allow me mrs micawber i shall now have the pleasure of drinking your health madam’ on which mr micawber delivered an eulogium on mrs micawber’s character and said she had ever been his guide philosopher and friend and that he would recommend me when i came to a marrying time of life to marry such another woman if such another woman could be found as the punch disappeared mr micawber became still more friendly and convivial mrs micawber’s spirits becoming elevated too we sang ‘auld lang syne’ when we came to ‘here is a hand my trusty frere’ we all joined hands round the table and when we declared we would ‘take a right gude willie waught’ and had not the least idea what it meant we were really affected in a word i never saw anybody so thoroughly jovial as mr micawber was down to the very last moment of the evening when i took a hearty farewell of himself and his amiable wife consequently i was not prepared at seven of the clock next morning to receive the following communication dated half past nine in the evening a quarter of an hour after i had left him ‘my dear young friend ‘the die is castall is over hiding the ravages of care with a sickly mask of mirth i have not informed you this evening that there is no hope of the remittance under these circumstances alike humiliating to endure humiliating to contemplate and humiliating to relate i have discharged the pecuniary liability contracted at this establishment by giving a note of hand made payable fourteen days after date at my residence pentonville london when it becomes due it will not be taken up the result is destruction the bolt is impending and the tree must fall ‘let the wretched man who now addresses you my dear copperfield be a beacon to you through life he writes with that intention and in that hope if he could think himself of so much use one gleam of day might by possibility penetrate into the cheerless dungeon of his remaining existencethough his longevity is at present to say the least of it extremely problematical ‘this is the last communication my dear copperfield you will ever receive ‘from ‘the ‘beggared outcast ‘wilkins micawber’ i was so shocked by the contents of this heartrending letter that i ran off directly towards the little hotel with the intention of taking it on my way to doctor strong’s and trying to soothe mr micawber with a word of comfort but halfway there i met the london coach with mr and mrs micawber up behind mr micawber the very picture of tranquil enjoyment smiling at mrs micawber’s conversation eating walnuts out of a paper bag with a bottle sticking out of his breast pocket as they did not see me i thought it best all things considered not to see them so with a great weight taken off my mind i turned into a bystreet that was the nearest way to school and felt upon the whole relieved that they were gone though i still liked them very much nevertheless
