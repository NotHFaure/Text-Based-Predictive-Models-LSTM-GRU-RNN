depression as soon as i could recover my presence of mind which quite deserted me in the first overpowering shock of my aunt’s intelligence i proposed to mr dick to come round to the chandler’s shop and take possession of the bed which mr peggotty had lately vacated the chandler’s shop being in hungerford market and hungerford market being a very different place in those days there was a low wooden colonnade before the door not very unlike that before the house where the little man and woman used to live in the old weatherglass which pleased mr dick mightily the glory of lodging over this structure would have compensated him i dare say for many inconveniences but as there were really few to bear beyond the compound of flavours i have already mentioned and perhaps the want of a little more elbowroom he was perfectly charmed with his accommodation mrs crupp had indignantly assured him that there was not room to swing a cat there but as mr dick justly observed to me sitting down on the foot of the bed nursing his leg ‘you know trotwood i do not want to swing a cat i never do swing a cat therefore what does that signify to me’ i tried to ascertain whether mr dick had any understanding of the causes of this sudden and great change in my aunt’s affairs as i might have expected he had none at all the only account he could give of it was that my aunt had said to him the day before yesterday ‘now dick are you really and truly the philosopher i take you for’ that then he had said yes he hoped so that then my aunt had said ‘dick i am ruined’ that then he had said ‘oh indeed’ that then my aunt had praised him highly which he was glad of and that then they had come to me and had had bottled porter and sandwiches on the road mr dick was so very complacent sitting on the foot of the bed nursing his leg and telling me this with his eyes wide open and a surprised smile that i am sorry to say i was provoked into explaining to him that ruin meant distress want and starvation but i was soon bitterly reproved for this harshness by seeing his face turn pale and tears course down his lengthened cheeks while he fixed upon me a look of such unutterable woe that it might have softened a far harder heart than mine i took infinitely greater pains to cheer him up again than i had taken to depress him and i soon understood as i ought to have known at first that he had been so confident merely because of his faith in the wisest and most wonderful of women and his unbounded reliance on my intellectual resources the latter i believe he considered a match for any kind of disaster not absolutely mortal ‘what can we do trotwood’ said mr dick ‘there is the memorial’ ‘to be sure there is’ said i ‘but all we can do just now mr dick is to keep a cheerful countenance and not let my aunt see that we are thinking about it’ he assented to this in the most earnest manner and implored me if i should see him wandering an inch out of the right course to recall him by some of those superior methods which were always at my command but i regret to state that the fright i had given him proved too much for his best attempts at concealment all the evening his eyes wandered to my aunt’s face with an expression of the most dismal apprehension as if he saw her growing thin on the spot he was conscious of this and put a constraint upon his head but his keeping that immovable and sitting rolling his eyes like a piece of machinery did not mend the matter at all i saw him look at the loaf at supper which happened to be a small one as if nothing else stood between us and famine and when my aunt insisted on his making his customary repast i detected him in the act of pocketing fragments of his bread and cheese i have no doubt for the purpose of reviving us with those savings when we should have reached an advanced stage of attenuation my aunt on the other hand was in a composed frame of mind which was a lesson to all of usto me i am sure she was extremely gracious to peggotty except when i inadvertently called her by that name and strange as i knew she felt in london appeared quite at home she was to have my bed and i was to lie in the sittingroom to keep guard over her she made a great point of being so near the river in case of a conflagration and i suppose really did find some satisfaction in that circumstance ‘trot my dear’ said my aunt when she saw me making preparations for compounding her usual nightdraught ‘no’ ‘nothing aunt’ ‘not wine my dear ale’ ‘but there is wine here aunt and you always have it made of wine’ ‘keep that in case of sickness’ said my aunt ‘we must not use it carelessly trot ale for me half a pint’ i thought mr dick would have fallen insensible my aunt being resolute i went out and got the ale myself as it was growing late peggotty and mr dick took that opportunity of repairing to the chandler’s shop together i parted from him poor fellow at the corner of the street with his great kite at his back a very monument of human misery my aunt was walking up and down the room when i returned crimping the borders of her nightcap with her fingers i warmed the ale and made the toast on the usual infallible principles when it was ready for her she was ready for it with her nightcap on and the skirt of her gown turned back on her knees ‘my dear’ said my aunt after taking a spoonful of it ‘it is a great deal better than wine not half so bilious’ i suppose i looked doubtful for she added ‘tut tut child if nothing worse than ale happens to us we are well off’ ‘i should think so myself aunt i am sure’ said i ‘well then why do not you think so’ said my aunt ‘because you and i are very different people’ i returned ‘stuff and nonsense trot’ replied my aunt my aunt went on with a quiet enjoyment in which there was very little affectation if any drinking the warm ale with a teaspoon and soaking her strips of toast in it ‘trot’ said she ‘i do not care for strange faces in general but i rather like that barkis of yours do you know’ ‘it is better than a hundred pounds to hear you say so’ said i ‘it is a most extraordinary world’ observed my aunt rubbing her nose ‘how that woman ever got into it with that name is unaccountable to me it would be much more easy to be born a jackson or something of that sort one would think’ ‘perhaps she thinks so too it is not her fault’ said i ‘i suppose not’ returned my aunt rather grudging the admission ‘but it is very aggravating however she is barkis now that is some comfort barkis is uncommonly fond of you trot’ ‘there is nothing she would leave undone to prove it’ said i ‘nothing i believe’ returned my aunt ‘here the poor fool has been begging and praying about handing over some of her moneybecause she has got too much of it a simpleton’ my aunt’s tears of pleasure were positively trickling down into the warm ale ‘she is the most ridiculous creature that ever was born’ said my aunt ‘i knew from the first moment when i saw her with that poor dear blessed baby of a mother of yours that she was the most ridiculous of mortals but there are good points in barkis’ affecting to laugh she got an opportunity of putting her hand to her eyes having availed herself of it she resumed her toast and her discourse together ‘ah mercy upon us’ sighed my aunt ‘i know all about it trot barkis and myself had quite a gossip while you were out with dick i know all about it i do not know where these wretched girls expect to go to for my part i wonder they do not knock out their brains againstagainst mantelpieces’ said my aunt an idea which was probably suggested to her by her contemplation of mine ‘poor emily’ said i ‘oh do not talk to me about poor’ returned my aunt ‘she should have thought of that before she caused so much misery give me a kiss trot i am sorry for your early experience’ as i bent forward she put her tumbler on my knee to detain me and said ‘oh trot trot and so you fancy yourself in love do you’ ‘fancy aunt’ i exclaimed as red as i could be ‘i adore her with my whole soul’ ‘dora indeed’ returned my aunt ‘and you mean to say the little thing is very fascinating i suppose’ ‘my dear aunt’ i replied ‘no one can form the least idea what she is’ ‘ah and not silly’ said my aunt ‘silly aunt’ i seriously believe it had never once entered my head for a single moment to consider whether she was or not i resented the idea of course but i was in a manner struck by it as a new one altogether ‘not lightheaded’ said my aunt ‘lightheaded aunt’ i could only repeat this daring speculation with the same kind of feeling with which i had repeated the preceding question ‘well well’ said my aunt ‘i only ask i do not depreciate her poor little couple and so you think you were formed for one another and are to go through a partysuppertable kind of life like two pretty pieces of confectionery do you trot’ she asked me this so kindly and with such a gentle air half playful and half sorrowful that i was quite touched ‘we are young and inexperienced aunt i know’ i replied ‘and i dare say we say and think a good deal that is rather foolish but we love one another truly i am sure if i thought dora could ever love anybody else or cease to love me or that i could ever love anybody else or cease to love her i do not know what i should dogo out of my mind i think’ ‘ah trot’ said my aunt shaking her head and smiling gravely ‘blind blind blind’ ‘someone that i know trot’ my aunt pursued after a pause ‘though of a very pliant disposition has an earnestness of affection in him that reminds me of poor baby earnestness is what that somebody must look for to sustain him and improve him trot deep downright faithful earnestness’ ‘if you only knew the earnestness of dora aunt’ i cried ‘oh trot’ she said again ‘blind blind’ and without knowing why i felt a vague unhappy loss or want of something overshadow me like a cloud ‘however’ said my aunt ‘i do not want to put two young creatures out of conceit with themselves or to make them unhappy so though it is a girl and boy attachment and girl and boy attachments very oftenmind i do not say alwayscome to nothing still we will be serious about it and hope for a prosperous issue one of these days there is time enough for it to come to anything’ this was not upon the whole very comforting to a rapturous lover but i was glad to have my aunt in my confidence and i was mindful of her being fatigued so i thanked her ardently for this mark of her affection and for all her other kindnesses towards me and after a tender good night she took her nightcap into my bedroom how miserable i was when i lay down how i thought and thought about my being poor in mr spenlow’s eyes about my not being what i thought i was when i proposed to dora about the chivalrous necessity of telling dora what my worldly condition was and releasing her from her engagement if she thought fit about how i should contrive to live during the long term of my articles when i was earning nothing about doing something to assist my aunt and seeing no way of doing anything about coming down to have no money in my pocket and to wear a shabby coat and to be able to carry dora no little presents and to ride no gallant greys and to show myself in no agreeable light sordid and selfish as i knew it was and as i tortured myself by knowing that it was to let my mind run on my own distress so much i was so devoted to dora that i could not help it i knew that it was base in me not to think more of my aunt and less of myself but so far selfishness was inseparable from dora and i could not put dora on one side for any mortal creature how exceedingly miserable i was that night as to sleep i had dreams of poverty in all sorts of shapes but i seemed to dream without the previous ceremony of going to sleep now i was ragged wanting to sell dora matches six bundles for a halfpenny now i was at the office in a nightgown and boots remonstrated with by mr spenlow on appearing before the clients in that airy attire now i was hungrily picking up the crumbs that fell from old tiffey’s daily biscuit regularly eaten when st paul’s struck one now i was hopelessly endeavouring to get a licence to marry dora having nothing but one of uriah heep’s gloves to offer in exchange which the whole commons rejected and still more or less conscious of my own room i was always tossing about like a distressed ship in a sea of bedclothes my aunt was restless too for i frequently heard her walking to and fro two or three times in the course of the night attired in a long flannel wrapper in which she looked seven feet high she appeared like a disturbed ghost in my room and came to the side of the sofa on which i lay on the first occasion i started up in alarm to learn that she inferred from a particular light in the sky that westminster abbey was on fire and to be consulted in reference to the probability of its igniting buckingham street in case the wind changed lying still after that i found that she sat down near me whispering to herself ‘poor boy’ and then it made me twenty times more wretched to know how unselfishly mindful she was of me and how selfishly mindful i was of myself it was difficult to believe that a night so long to me could be short to anybody else this consideration set me thinking and thinking of an imaginary party where people were dancing the hours away until that became a dream too and i heard the music incessantly playing one tune and saw dora incessantly dancing one dance without taking the least notice of me the man who had been playing the harp all night was trying in vain to cover it with an ordinarysized nightcap when i awoke or i should rather say when i left off trying to go to sleep and saw the sun shining in through the window at last there was an old roman bath in those days at the bottom of one of the streets out of the strandit may be there stillin which i have had many a cold plunge dressing myself as quietly as i could and leaving peggotty to look after my aunt i tumbled head foremost into it and then went for a walk to hampstead i had a hope that this brisk treatment might freshen my wits a little and i think it did them good for i soon came to the conclusion that the first step i ought to take was to try if my articles could be cancelled and the premium recovered i got some breakfast on the heath and walked back to doctors’ commons along the watered roads and through a pleasant smell of summer flowers growing in gardens and carried into town on hucksters’ heads intent on this first effort to meet our altered circumstances i arrived at the office so soon after all that i had half an hour’s loitering about the commons before old tiffey who was always first appeared with his key then i sat down in my shady corner looking up at the sunlight on the opposite chimneypots and thinking about dora until mr spenlow came in crisp and curly ‘how are you copperfield’ said he ‘fine morning’ ‘beautiful morning sir’ said i ‘could i say a word to you before you go into court’ ‘by all means’ said he ‘come into my room’ i followed him into his room and he began putting on his gown and touching himself up before a little glass he had hanging inside a closet door ‘i am sorry to say’ said i ‘that i have some rather disheartening intelligence from my aunt’ ‘no’ said he ‘dear me not paralysis i hope’ ‘it has no reference to her health sir’ i replied ‘she has met with some large losses in fact she has very little left indeed’ ‘you astound me copperfield’ cried mr spenlow i shook my head ‘indeed sir’ said i ‘her affairs are so changed that i wished to ask you whether it would be possibleat a sacrifice on our part of some portion of the premium of course’ i put in this on the spur of the moment warned by the blank expression of his face‘to cancel my articles’ what it cost me to make this proposal nobody knows it was like asking as a favour to be sentenced to transportation from dora ‘to cancel your articles copperfield cancel’ i explained with tolerable firmness that i really did not know where my means of subsistence were to come from unless i could earn them for myself i had no fear for the future i saidand i laid great emphasis on that as if to imply that i should still be decidedly eligible for a soninlaw one of these daysbut for the present i was thrown upon my own resources ‘i am extremely sorry to hear this copperfield’ said mr spenlow ‘extremely sorry it is not usual to cancel articles for any such reason it is not a professional course of proceeding it is not a convenient precedent at all far from it at the same time’ ‘you are very good sir’ i murmured anticipating a concession ‘not at all do not mention it’ said mr spenlow ‘at the same time i was going to say if it had been my lot to have my hands unfetteredif i had not a partnermr jorkins’ my hopes were dashed in a moment but i made another effort ‘do you think sir’ said i ‘if i were to mention it to mr jorkins’ mr spenlow shook his head discouragingly ‘heaven forbid copperfield’ he replied ‘that i should do any man an injustice still less mr jorkins but i know my partner copperfield mr jorkins is not a man to respond to a proposition of this peculiar nature mr jorkins is very difficult to move from the beaten track you know what he is’ i am sure i knew nothing about him except that he had originally been alone in the business and now lived by himself in a house near montagu square which was fearfully in want of painting that he came very late of a day and went away very early that he never appeared to be consulted about anything and that he had a dingy little blackhole of his own upstairs where no business was ever done and where there was a yellow old cartridgepaper pad upon his desk unsoiled by ink and reported to be twenty years of age ‘would you object to my mentioning it to him sir’ i asked ‘by no means’ said mr spenlow ‘but i have some experience of mr jorkins copperfield i wish it were otherwise for i should be happy to meet your views in any respect i cannot have the objection to your mentioning it to mr jorkins copperfield if you think it worth while’ availing myself of this permission which was given with a warm shake of the hand i sat thinking about dora and looking at the sunlight stealing from the chimneypots down the wall of the opposite house until mr jorkins came i then went up to mr jorkins’s room and evidently astonished mr jorkins very much by making my appearance there ‘come in mr copperfield’ said mr jorkins ‘come in’ i went in and sat down and stated my case to mr jorkins pretty much as i had stated it to mr spenlow mr jorkins was not by any means the awful creature one might have expected but a large mild smoothfaced man of sixty who took so much snuff that there was a tradition in the commons that he lived principally on that stimulant having little room in his system for any other article of diet ‘you have mentioned this to mr spenlow i suppose’ said mr jorkins when he had heard me very restlessly to an end i answered yes and told him that mr spenlow had introduced his name ‘he said i should object’ asked mr jorkins i was obliged to admit that mr spenlow had considered it probable ‘i am sorry to say mr copperfield i cannot advance your object’ said mr jorkins nervously ‘the fact isbut i have an appointment at the bank if you will have the goodness to excuse me’ with that he rose in a great hurry and was going out of the room when i made bold to say that i feared then there was no way of arranging the matter ‘no’ said mr jorkins stopping at the door to shake his head ‘oh no i object you know’ which he said very rapidly and went out ‘you must be aware mr copperfield’ he added looking restlessly in at the door again ‘if mr spenlow objects’ ‘personally he does not object sir’ said i ‘oh personally’ repeated mr jorkins in an impatient manner ‘i assure you there is an objection mr copperfield hopeless what you wish to be done cannot be done ii really have got an appointment at the bank’ with that he fairly ran away and to the best of my knowledge it was three days before he showed himself in the commons again being very anxious to leave no stone unturned i waited until mr spenlow came in and then described what had passed giving him to understand that i was not hopeless of his being able to soften the adamantine jorkins if he would undertake the task ‘copperfield’ returned mr spenlow with a gracious smile ‘you have not known my partner mr jorkins as long as i have nothing is farther from my thoughts than to attribute any degree of artifice to mr jorkins but mr jorkins has a way of stating his objections which often deceives people no copperfield’ shaking his head ‘mr jorkins is not to be moved believe me’ i was completely bewildered between mr spenlow and mr jorkins as to which of them really was the objecting partner but i saw with sufficient clearness that there was obduracy somewhere in the firm and that the recovery of my aunt’s thousand pounds was out of the question in a state of despondency which i remember with anything but satisfaction for i know it still had too much reference to myself though always in connexion with dora i left the office and went homeward i was trying to familiarize my mind with the worst and to present to myself the arrangements we should have to make for the future in their sternest aspect when a hackneychariot coming after me and stopping at my very feet occasioned me to look up a fair hand was stretched forth to me from the window and the face i had never seen without a feeling of serenity and happiness from the moment when it first turned back on the old oak staircase with the great broad balustrade and when i associated its softened beauty with the stainedglass window in the church was smiling on me ‘agnes’ i joyfully exclaimed ‘oh my dear agnes of all people in the world what a pleasure to see you’ ‘is it indeed’ she said in her cordial voice ‘i want to talk to you so much’ said i ‘it is such a lightening of my heart only to look at you if i had had a conjuror’s cap there is no one i should have wished for but you’ ‘what’ returned agnes ‘well perhaps dora first’ i admitted with a blush ‘certainly dora first i hope’ said agnes laughing ‘but you next’ said i ‘where are you going’ she was going to my rooms to see my aunt the day being very fine she was glad to come out of the chariot which smelt i had my head in it all this time like a stable put under a cucumberframe i dismissed the coachman and she took my arm and we walked on together she was like hope embodied to me how different i felt in one short minute having agnes at my side my aunt had written her one of the odd abrupt notesvery little longer than a bank noteto which her epistolary efforts were usually limited she had stated therein that she had fallen into adversity and was leaving dover for good but had quite made up her mind to it and was so well that nobody need be uncomfortable about her agnes had come to london to see my aunt between whom and herself there had been a mutual liking these many years indeed it dated from the time of my taking up my residence in mr wickfield’s house she was not alone she said her papa was with herand uriah heep ‘and now they are partners’ said i ‘confound him’ ‘yes’ said agnes ‘they have some business here and i took advantage of their coming to come too you must not think my visit all friendly and disinterested trotwood fori am afraid i may be cruelly prejudicedi do not like to let papa go away alone with him’ ‘does he exercise the same influence over mr wickfield still agnes’ agnes shook her head ‘there is such a change at home’ said she ‘that you would scarcely know the dear old house they live with us now’ ‘they’ said i ‘mr heep and his mother he sleeps in your old room’ said agnes looking up into my face ‘i wish i had the ordering of his dreams’ said i ‘he would not sleep there long’ ‘i keep my own little room’ said agnes ‘where i used to learn my lessons how the time goes you remember the little panelled room that opens from the drawingroom’ ‘remember agnes when i saw you for the first time coming out at the door with your quaint little basket of keys hanging at your side’ ‘it is just the same’ said agnes smiling ‘i am glad you think of it so pleasantly we were very happy’ ‘we were indeed’ said i ‘i keep that room to myself still but i cannot always desert mrs heep you know and so’ said agnes quietly ‘i feel obliged to bear her company when i might prefer to be alone but i have no other reason to complain of her if she tires me sometimes by her praises of her son it is only natural in a mother he is a very good son to her’ i looked at agnes when she said these words without detecting in her any consciousness of uriah’s design her mild but earnest eyes met mine with their own beautiful frankness and there was no change in her gentle face ‘the chief evil of their presence in the house’ said agnes ‘is that i cannot be as near papa as i could wishuriah heep being so much between usand cannot watch over him if that is not too bold a thing to say as closely as i would but if any fraud or treachery is practising against him i hope that simple love and truth will be strong in the end i hope that real love and truth are stronger in the end than any evil or misfortune in the world’ a certain bright smile which i never saw on any other face died away even while i thought how good it was and how familiar it had once been to me and she asked me with a quick change of expression we were drawing very near my street if i knew how the reverse in my aunt’s circumstances had been brought about on my replying no she had not told me yet agnes became thoughtful and i fancied i felt her arm tremble in mine we found my aunt alone in a state of some excitement a difference of opinion had arisen between herself and mrs crupp on an abstract question the propriety of chambers being inhabited by the gentler sex and my aunt utterly indifferent to spasms on the part of mrs crupp had cut the dispute short by informing that lady that she smelt of my brandy and that she would trouble her to walk out both of these expressions mrs crupp considered actionable and had expressed her intention of bringing before a ‘british judy’meaning it was supposed the bulwark of our national liberties my aunt however having had time to cool while peggotty was out showing mr dick the soldiers at the horse guardsand being besides greatly pleased to see agnesrather plumed herself on the affair than otherwise and received us with unimpaired good humour when agnes laid her bonnet on the table and sat down beside her i could not but think looking on her mild eyes and her radiant forehead how natural it seemed to have her there how trustfully although she was so young and inexperienced my aunt confided in her how strong she was indeed in simple love and truth we began to talk about my aunt’s losses and i told them what i had tried to do that morning ‘which was injudicious trot’ said my aunt ‘but well meant you are a generous boyi suppose i must say young man nowand i am proud of you my dear so far so good now trot and agnes let us look the case of betsey trotwood in the face and see how it stands’ i observed agnes turn pale as she looked very attentively at my aunt my aunt patting her cat looked very attentively at agnes ‘betsey trotwood’ said my aunt who had always kept her money matters to herself ‘i do not mean your sister trot my dear but myselfhad a certain property it do not matter how much enough to live on more for she had saved a little and added to it betsey funded her property for some time and then by the advice of her man of business laid it out on landed security that did very well and returned very good interest till betsey was paid off i am talking of betsey as if she was a manofwar well then betsey had to look about her for a new investment she thought she was wiser now than her man of business who was not such a good man of business by this time as he used to bei am alluding to your father agnesand she took it into her head to lay it out for herself so she took her pigs’ said my aunt ‘to a foreign market and a very bad market it turned out to be first she lost in the mining way and then she lost in the diving wayfishing up treasure or some such tom tiddler nonsense’ explained my aunt rubbing her nose ‘and then she lost in the mining way again and last of all to set the thing entirely to rights she lost in the banking way i do not know what the bank shares were worth for a little while’ said my aunt ‘cent per cent was the lowest of it i believe but the bank was at the other end of the world and tumbled into space for what i know anyhow it fell to pieces and never will and never can pay sixpence and betsey’s sixpences were all there and there is an end of them least said soonest mended’ my aunt concluded this philosophical summary by fixing her eyes with a kind of triumph on agnes whose colour was gradually returning ‘dear miss trotwood is that all the history’ said agnes ‘i hope it is enough child’ said my aunt ‘if there had been more money to lose it would not have been all i dare say betsey would have contrived to throw that after the rest and make another have little doubt but there was no more money and there is no more story’ agnes had listened at first with suspended breath her colour still came and went but she breathed more freely i thought i knew why i thought she had had some fear that her unhappy father might be in some way to blame for what had happened my aunt took her hand in hers and laughed ‘is that all’ repeated my aunt ‘why yes that is all except “and she lived happy ever afterwards” perhaps i may add that of betsey yet one of these days now agnes you have a wise head so have you trot in some things though i cannot compliment you always’ and here my aunt shook her own at me with an energy peculiar to herself ‘what is to be done here is the cottage taking one time with another will produce say seventy pounds a year i think we may safely put it down at that wellthat is all we have got’ said my aunt with whom it was an idiosyncrasy as it is with some horses to stop very short when she appeared to be in a fair way of going on for a long while ‘then’ said my aunt after a rest ‘there is dick he is good for a hundred ayear but of course that must be expended on himself i would sooner send him away though i know i am the only person who appreciates him than have him and not spend his money on himself how can trot and i do best upon our means what do you say agnes’ ‘i say aunt’ i interposed ‘that i must do something’ ‘go for a soldier do you mean’ returned my aunt alarmed ‘or go to sea i will not hear of it you are to be a proctor we are not going to have any knockings on the head in this family if you please sir’ i was about to explain that i was not desirous of introducing that mode of provision into the family when agnes inquired if my rooms were held for any long term ‘you come to the point my dear’ said my aunt ‘they are not to be got rid of for six months at least unless they could be underlet and that i do not believe the last man died here five people out of six would dieof courseof that woman in nankeen with the flannel petticoat i have a little ready money and i agree with you the best thing we can do is to live the term out here and get a bedroom hard by’ i thought it my duty to hint at the discomfort my aunt would sustain from living in a continual state of guerilla warfare with mrs crupp but she disposed of that objection summarily by declaring that on the first demonstration of hostilities she was prepared to astonish mrs crupp for the whole remainder of her natural life ‘i have been thinking trotwood’ said agnes diffidently ‘that if you had time’ ‘i have a good deal of time agnes i am always disengaged after four or five of the clock and i have time early in the morning in one way and another’ said i conscious of reddening a little as i thought of the hours and hours i had devoted to fagging about town and to and fro upon the norwood road ‘i have abundance of time’ ‘i know you would not mind’ said agnes coming to me and speaking in a low voice so full of sweet and hopeful consideration that i hear it now ‘the duties of a secretary’ ‘mind my dear agnes’ ‘because’ continued agnes ‘doctor strong has acted on his intention of retiring and has come to live in london and he asked papa i know if he could recommend him one do not you think he would rather have his favourite old pupil near him than anybody else’ ‘dear agnes’ said i ‘what should i do without you you are always my good angel i told you so i never think of you in any other light’ agnes answered with her pleasant laugh that one good angel meaning dora was enough and went on to remind me that the doctor had been used to occupy himself in his study early in the morning and in the eveningand that probably my leisure would suit his requirements very well i was scarcely more delighted with the prospect of earning my own bread than with the hope of earning it under my old master in short acting on the advice of agnes i sat down and wrote a letter to the doctor stating my object and appointing to call on him next day at ten in the forenoon this i addressed to highgatefor in that place so memorable to me he livedand went and posted myself without losing a minute wherever agnes was some agreeable token of her noiseless presence seemed inseparable from the place when i came back i found my aunt’s birds hanging just as they had hung so long in the parlour window of the cottage and my easychair imitating my aunt’s much easier chair in its position at the open window and even the round green fan which my aunt had brought away with her screwed on to the windowsill i knew who had done all this by its seeming to have quietly done itself and i should have known in a moment who had arranged my neglected books in the old order of my school days even if i had supposed agnes to be miles away instead of seeing her busy with them and smiling at the disorder into which they had fallen my aunt was quite gracious on the subject of the thames it really did look very well with the sun upon it though not like the sea before the cottage but she could not relent towards the london smoke which she said ‘peppered everything’ a complete revolution in which peggotty bore a prominent part was being effected in every corner of my rooms in regard of this pepper and i was looking on thinking how little even peggotty seemed to do with a good deal of bustle and how much agnes did without any bustle at all when a knock came at the door ‘i think’ said agnes turning pale ‘it is papa he promised me that he would come’ i opened the door and admitted not only mr wickfield but uriah heep i had not seen mr wickfield for some time i was prepared for a great change in him after what i had heard from agnes but his appearance shocked me it was not that he looked many years older though still dressed with the old scrupulous cleanliness or that there was an unwholesome ruddiness upon his face or that his eyes were full and bloodshot or that there was a nervous trembling in his hand the because of which i knew and had for some years seen at work it was not that he had lost his good looks or his old bearing of a gentlemanfor that he had notbut the thing that struck me most was that with the evidences of his native superiority still upon him he should submit himself to that crawling impersonation of meanness uriah heep the reversal of the two natures in their relative positions uriah’s of power and mr wickfield’s of dependence was a sight more painful to me than i can express if i had seen an ape taking command of a man i should hardly have thought it a more degrading spectacle he appeared to be only too conscious of it himself when he came in he stood still and with his head bowed as if he felt it this was only for a moment for agnes softly said to him ‘papa here is miss trotwoodand trotwood whom you have not seen for a long while’ and then he approached and constrainedly gave my aunt his hand and shook hands more cordially with me in the moment’s pause i speak of i saw uriah’s countenance form itself into a most illfavoured smile agnes saw it too i think for she shrank from him what my aunt saw or did not see i defy the science of physiognomy to have made out without her own consent i believe there never was anybody with such an imperturbable countenance when she chose her face might have been a deadwall on the occasion in question for any light it threw upon her thoughts until she broke silence with her usual abruptness ‘well wickfield’ said my aunt and he looked up at her for the first time ‘i have been telling your daughter how well i have been disposing of my money for myself because i could not trust it to you as you were growing rusty in business matters we have been taking counsel together and getting on very well all things considered agnes is worth the whole firm in my opinion’ ‘if i may umbly make the remark’ said uriah heep with a writhe ‘i fully agree with miss betsey trotwood and should be only too appy if miss agnes was a partner’ ‘you are a partner yourself you know’ returned my aunt ‘and that is about enough for you i expect how do you find yourself sir’ in acknowledgement of this question addressed to him with extraordinary curtness mr heep uncomfortably clutching the blue bag he carried replied that he was pretty well he thanked my aunt and hoped she was the same ‘and you masteri should say mister copperfield’ pursued uriah ‘i hope i see you well i am rejoiced to see you mister copperfield even under present circumstances’ i believed that for he seemed to relish them very much ‘present circumstances is not what your friends would wish for you mister copperfield but it is not money makes the man it isi am really unequal with my umble powers to express what it is’ said uriah with a fawning jerk ‘but it is not money’ here he shook hands with me not in the common way but standing at a good distance from me and lifting my hand up and down like a pump handle that he was a little afraid of ‘and how do you think we are looking master copperfieldi should say mister’ fawned uriah ‘do not you find mr wickfield blooming sir years do not tell much in our firm master copperfield except in raising up the umble namely mother and selfand in developing’ he added as an afterthought ‘the beautiful namely miss agnes’ he jerked himself about after this compliment in such an intolerable manner that my aunt who had sat looking straight at him lost all patience ‘deuce take the man’ said my aunt sternly ‘what is he about do not be galvanic sir’ ‘i ask your pardon miss trotwood’ returned uriah ‘i am aware you are nervous’ ‘go along with you sir’ said my aunt anything but appeased ‘do not presume to say so i am nothing of the sort if you are an eel sir conduct yourself like one if you are a man control your limbs sir good god’ said my aunt with great indignation ‘i am not going to be serpentined and corkscrewed out of my senses’ mr heep was rather abashed as most people might have been by this explosion which derived great additional force from the indignant manner in which my aunt afterwards moved in her chair and shook her head as if she were making snaps or bounces at him but he said to me aside in a meek voice ‘i am well aware master copperfield that miss trotwood though an excellent lady has a quick temper indeed i think i had the pleasure of knowing her when i was a numble clerk before you did master copperfield and it is only natural i am sure that it should be made quicker by present circumstances the wonder is that it is not much worse i only called to say that if there was anything we could do in present circumstances mother or self or wickfield and heepwe should be really glad i may go so far’ said uriah with a sickly smile at his partner ‘uriah heep’ said mr wickfield in a monotonous forced way ‘is active in the business trotwood what he says i quite concur in you know i had an old interest in you apart from that what uriah says i quite concur in’ ‘oh what a reward it is’ said uriah drawing up one leg at the risk of bringing down upon himself another visitation from my aunt ‘to be so trusted in but i hope i am able to do something to relieve him from the fatigues of business master copperfield’ ‘uriah heep is a great relief to me’ said mr wickfield in the same dull voice ‘it is a load off my mind trotwood to have such a partner’ the red fox made him say all this i knew to exhibit him to me in the light he had indicated on the night when he poisoned my rest i saw the same illfavoured smile upon his face again and saw how he watched me ‘you are not going papa’ said agnes anxiously ‘will you not walk back with trotwood and me’ he would have looked to uriah i believe before replying if that worthy had not anticipated him ‘i am bespoke myself’ said uriah ‘on business otherwise i should have been appy to have kept with my friends but i leave my partner to represent the firm miss agnes ever yours i wish you goodday master copperfield and leave my umble respects for miss betsey trotwood’ with those words he retired kissing his great hand and leering at us like a mask we sat there talking about our pleasant old canterbury days an hour or two mr wickfield left to agnes soon became more like his former self though there was a settled depression upon him which he never shook off for all that he brightened and had an evident pleasure in hearing us recall the little incidents of our old life many of which he remembered very well he said it was like those times to be alone with agnes and me again and he wished to heaven they had never changed i am sure there was an influence in the placid face of agnes and in the very touch of her hand upon his arm that did wonders for him my aunt who was busy nearly all this while with peggotty in the inner room would not accompany us to the place where they were staying but insisted on my going and i went we dined together after dinner agnes sat beside him as of old and poured out his wine he took what she gave him and no morelike a childand we all three sat together at a window as the evening gathered in when it was almost dark he lay down on a sofa agnes pillowing his head and bending over him a little while and when she came back to the window it was not so dark but i could see tears glittering in her eyes i pray heaven that i never may forget the dear girl in her love and truth at that time of my life for if i should i must be drawing near the end and then i would desire to remember her best she filled my heart with such good resolutions strengthened my weakness so by her example so directedi know not how she was too modest and gentle to advise me in many wordsthe wandering ardour and unsettled purpose within me that all the little good i have done and all the harm i have forborne i solemnly believe i may refer to her and how she spoke to me of dora sitting at the window in the dark listened to my praises of her praised again and round the little fairyfigure she would some glimpses of her own pure light that made it yet more precious and more innocent to me oh agnes sister of my boyhood if i had known then what i knew long afterwards there was a beggar in the street when i went down and as i turned my head towards the window thinking of her calm seraphic eyes he made me start by muttering as if he were an echo of the morning ‘blind blind blind’
