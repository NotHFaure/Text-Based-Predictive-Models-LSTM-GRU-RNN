some old scenes and some new people steerforth and i stayed for more than a fortnight in that part of the country we were very much together i need not say but occasionally we were asunder for some hours at a time he was a good sailor and i was but an indifferent one and when he went out boating with mr peggotty which was a favourite amusement of his i generally remained ashore my occupation of peggotty’s spareroom put a constraint upon me from which he was free for knowing how assiduously she attended on mr barkis all day i did not like to remain out late at night whereas steerforth lying at the inn had nothing to consult but his own humour thus it came about that i heard of his making little treats for the fishermen at mr peggotty’s house of call ‘the willing mind’ after i was in bed and of his being afloat wrapped in fishermen’s clothes whole moonlight nights and coming back when the morning tide was at flood by this time however i knew that his restless nature and bold spirits delighted to find a vent in rough toil and hard weather as in any other means of excitement that presented itself freshly to him so none of his proceedings surprised me another because of our being sometimes apart was that i had naturally an interest in going over to blunderstone and revisiting the old familiar scenes of my childhood while steerforth after being there once had naturally no great interest in going there again hence on three or four days that i can at once recall we went our several ways after an early breakfast and met again at a late dinner i had no idea how he employed his time in the interval beyond a general knowledge that he was very popular in the place and had twenty means of actively diverting himself where another man might not have found one for my own part my occupation in my solitary pilgrimages was to recall every yard of the old road as i went along it and to haunt the old spots of which i never tired i haunted them as my memory had often done and lingered among them as my younger thoughts had lingered when i was far away the grave beneath the tree where both my parents layon which i had looked out when it was my father’s only with such curious feelings of compassion and by which i had stood so desolate when it was opened to receive my pretty mother and her babythe grave which peggotty’s own faithful care had ever since kept neat and made a garden of i walked near by the hour it lay a little off the churchyard path in a quiet corner not so far removed but i could read the names upon the stone as i walked to and fro startled by the sound of the churchbell when it struck the hour for it was like a departed voice to me my reflections at these times were always associated with the figure i was to make in life and the distinguished things i was to do my echoing footsteps went to no other tune but were as constant to that as if i had come home to build my castles in the air at a living mother’s side there were great changes in my old home the ragged nests so long deserted by the rooks were gone and the trees were lopped and topped out of their remembered shapes the garden had run wild and half the windows of the house were shut up it was occupied but only by a poor lunatic gentleman and the people who took care of him he was always sitting at my little window looking out into the churchyard and i wondered whether his rambling thoughts ever went upon any of the fancies that used to occupy mine on the rosy mornings when i peeped out of that same little window in my nightclothes and saw the sheep quietly feeding in the light of the rising sun our old neighbours mr and mrs grayper were gone to south america and the rain had made its way through the roof of their empty house and stained the outer walls mr chillip was married again to a tall rawboned highnosed wife and they had a weazen little baby with a heavy head that it could not hold up and two weak staring eyes with which it seemed to be always wondering why it had ever been born it was with a singular jumble of sadness and pleasure that i used to linger about my native place until the reddening winter sun admonished me that it was time to start on my returning walk but when the place was left behind and especially when steerforth and i were happily seated over our dinner by a blazing fire it was delicious to think of having been there so it was though in a softened degree when i went to my neat room at night and turning over the leaves of the crocodilebook which was always there upon a little table remembered with a grateful heart how blest i was in having such a friend as steerforth such a friend as peggotty and such a substitute for what i had lost as my excellent and generous aunt my nearest way to yarmouth in coming back from these long walks was by a ferry it landed me on the flat between the town and the sea which i could make straight across and so save myself a considerable circuit by the high road mr peggotty’s house being on that wasteplace and not a hundred yards out of my track i always looked in as i went by steerforth was pretty sure to be there expecting me and we went on together through the frosty air and gathering fog towards the twinkling lights of the town one dark evening when i was later than usualfor i had that day been making my parting visit to blunderstone as we were now about to return homei found him alone in mr peggotty’s house sitting thoughtfully before the fire he was so intent upon his own reflections that he was quite unconscious of my approach this indeed he might easily have been if he had been less absorbed for footsteps fell noiselessly on the sandy ground outside but even my entrance failed to rouse him i was standing close to him looking at him and still with a heavy brow he was lost in his meditations he gave such a start when i put my hand upon his shoulder that he made me start too ‘you come upon me’ he said almost angrily ‘like a reproachful ghost’ ‘i was obliged to announce myself somehow’ i replied ‘have i called you down from the stars’ ‘no’ he answered ‘no’ ‘up from anywhere then’ said i taking my seat near him ‘i was looking at the pictures in the fire’ he returned ‘but you are spoiling them for me’ said i as he stirred it quickly with a piece of burning wood striking out of it a train of redhot sparks that went careering up the little chimney and roaring out into the air ‘you would not have seen them’ he returned ‘i detest this mongrel time neither day nor night how late you are where have you been’ ‘i have been taking leave of my usual walk’ said i ‘and i have been sitting here’ said steerforth glancing round the room ‘thinking that all the people we found so glad on the night of our coming down mightto judge from the present wasted air of the placebe dispersed or dead or come to i do not know what harm david i wish to god i had had a judicious father these last twenty years’ ‘my dear steerforth what is the matter’ ‘i wish with all my soul i had been better guided’ he exclaimed ‘i wish with all my soul i could guide myself better’ there was a passionate dejection in his manner that quite amazed me he was more unlike himself than i could have supposed possible ‘it would be better to be this poor peggotty or his lout of a nephew’ he said getting up and leaning moodily against the chimneypiece with his face towards the fire ‘than to be myself twenty times richer and twenty times wiser and be the torment to myself that i have been in this devil’s bark of a boat within the last halfhour’ i was so confounded by the alteration in him that at first i could only observe him in silence as he stood leaning his head upon his hand and looking gloomily down at the fire at length i begged him with all the earnestness i felt to tell me what had occurred to cross him so unusually and to let me sympathize with him if i could not hope to advise him before i had well concluded he began to laughfretfully at first but soon with returning gaiety ‘tut it is nothing daisy nothing’ he replied ‘i told you at the inn in london i am heavy company for myself sometimes i have been a nightmare to myself just nowmust have had one i think at odd dull times nursery tales come up into the memory unrecognized for what they are i believe i have been confounding myself with the bad boy who “did not care” and became food for lionsa grander kind of going to the dogs i suppose what old women call the horrors have been creeping over me from head to foot i have been afraid of myself’ ‘you are afraid of nothing else i think’ said i ‘perhaps not and yet may have enough to be afraid of too’ he answered ‘well so it goes by i am not about to be hipped again david but i tell you my good fellow once more that it would have been well for me and for more than me if i had had a steadfast and judicious father’ his face was always full of expression but i never saw it express such a dark kind of earnestness as when he said these words with his glance bent on the fire ‘so much for that’ he said making as if he tossed something light into the air with his hand “‘why being gone i am a man again” like macbeth and now for dinner if i have not macbethlike broken up the feast with most admired disorder daisy’ ‘but where are they all i wonder’ said i ‘god knows’ said steerforth ‘after strolling to the ferry looking for you i strolled in here and found the place deserted that set me thinking and you found me thinking’ the advent of mrs gummidge with a basket explained how the house had happened to be empty she had hurried out to buy something that was needed against mr peggotty’s return with the tide and had left the door open in the meanwhile lest ham and little them’ly with whom it was an early night should come home while she was gone steerforth after very much improving mrs gummidge’s spirits by a cheerful salutation and a jocose embrace took my arm and hurried me away he had improved his own spirits no less than mrs gummidge’s for they were again at their usual flow and he was full of vivacious conversation as we went along ‘and so’ he said gaily ‘we abandon this buccaneer life tomorrow do we’ ‘so we agreed’ i returned ‘and our places by the coach are taken you know’ ‘ay there is no help for it i suppose’ said steerforth ‘i have almost forgotten that there is anything to do in the world but to go out tossing on the sea here i wish there was not’ ‘as long as the novelty should last’ said i laughing ‘like enough’ he returned ‘though there is a sarcastic meaning in that observation for an amiable piece of innocence like my young friend well i dare say i am a capricious fellow david i know i am but while the iron is hot i can strike it vigorously too i could pass a reasonably good examination already as a pilot in these waters i think’ ‘mr peggotty says you are a wonder’ i returned ‘a nautical phenomenon eh’ laughed steerforth ‘indeed he does and you know how truly i know how ardent you are in any pursuit you follow and how easily you can master it and that amazes me most in you steerforththat you should be contented with such fitful uses of your powers’ ‘contented’ he answered merrily ‘i am never contented except with your freshness my gentle daisy as to fitfulness i have never learnt the art of binding myself to any of the wheels on which the ixions of these days are turning round and round i missed it somehow in a bad apprenticeship and now do not care about ityou know i have bought a boat down here’ ‘what an extraordinary fellow you are steerforth’ i exclaimed stoppingfor this was the first i had heard of it ‘when you may never care to come near the place again’ ‘i do not know that’ he returned ‘i have taken a fancy to the place at all events’ walking me briskly on ‘i have bought a boat that was for salea clipper mr peggotty says and so she isand mr peggotty will be master of her in my absence’ ‘now i understand you steerforth’ said i exultingly ‘you pretend to have bought it for yourself but you have really done so to confer a benefit on him i might have known as much at first knowing you my dear kind steerforth how can i tell you what i think of your generosity’ ‘tush’ he answered turning red ‘the less said the better’ ‘did not i know’ cried i ‘did not i say that there was not a joy or sorrow or any emotion of such honest hearts that was indifferent to you’ ‘aye aye’ he answered ‘you told me all that there let it rest we have said enough’ afraid of offending him by pursuing the subject when he made so light of it i only pursued it in my thoughts as we went on at even a quicker pace than before ‘she must be newly rigged’ said steerforth ‘and i shall leave littimer behind to see it done that i may know she is quite complete did i tell you littimer had come down’ ‘no’ ‘oh yes came down this morning with a letter from my mother’ as our looks met i observed that he was pale even to his lips though he looked very steadily at me i feared that some difference between him and his mother might have led to his being in the frame of mind in which i had found him at the solitary fireside i hinted so ‘oh no’ he said shaking his head and giving a slight laugh ‘nothing of the sort yes he is come down that man of mine’ ‘the same as ever’ said i ‘the same as ever’ said steerforth ‘distant and quiet as the north pole he shall see to the boat being fresh named she is the “stormy petrel” now what does mr peggotty care for stormy petrels i will have her christened again’ ‘by what name’ i asked ‘the “little them’ly”’ as he had continued to look steadily at me i took it as a reminder that he objected to being extolled for his consideration i could not help showing in my face how much it pleased me but i said little and he resumed his usual smile and seemed relieved ‘but see here’ he said looking before us ‘where the original little them’ly comes and that fellow with her eh upon my soul he is a true knight he never leaves her’ ham was a boatbuilder in these days having improved a natural ingenuity in that handicraft until he had become a skilled workman he was in his workingdress and looked rugged enough but manly withal and a very fit protector for the blooming little creature at his side indeed there was a frankness in his face an honesty and an undisguised show of his pride in her and his love for her which were to me the best of good looks i thought as they came towards us that they were well matched even in that particular she withdrew her hand timidly from his arm as we stopped to speak to them and blushed as she gave it to steerforth and to me when they passed on after we had exchanged a few words she did not like to replace that hand but still appearing timid and constrained walked by herself i thought all this very pretty and engaging and steerforth seemed to think so too as we looked after them fading away in the light of a young moon suddenly there passed usevidently following thema young woman whose approach we had not observed but whose face i saw as she went by and thought i had a faint remembrance of she was lightly dressed looked bold and haggard and flaunting and poor but seemed for the time to have given all that to the wind which was blowing and to have nothing in her mind but going after them as the dark distant level absorbing their figures into itself left but itself visible between us and the sea and clouds her figure disappeared in like manner still no nearer to them than before ‘that is a black shadow to be following the girl’ said steerforth standing still ‘what does it mean’ he spoke in a low voice that sounded almost strange to me ‘she must have it in her mind to beg of them i think’ said i ‘a beggar would be no novelty’ said steerforth ‘but it is a strange thing that the beggar should take that shape tonight’ ‘why’ i asked ‘for no better reason truly than because i was thinking’ he said after a pause ‘of something like it when it came by where the devil did it come from i wonder’ ‘from the shadow of this wall i think’ said i as we emerged upon a road on which a wall abutted ‘it is gone’ he returned looking over his shoulder ‘and all ill go with it now for our dinner’ but he looked again over his shoulder towards the sealine glimmering afar off and yet again and he wondered about it in some broken expressions several times in the short remainder of our walk and only seemed to forget it when the light of fire and candle shone upon us seated warm and merry at table littimer was there and had his usual effect upon me when i said to him that i hoped mrs steerforth and miss dartle were well he answered respectfully and of course respectably that they were tolerably well he thanked me and had sent their compliments this was all and yet he seemed to me to say as plainly as a man could say ‘you are very young sir you are exceedingly young’ we had almost finished dinner when taking a step or two towards the table from the corner where he kept watch upon us or rather upon me as i felt he said to his master ‘i beg your pardon sir miss mowcher is down here’ ‘who’ cried steerforth much astonished ‘miss mowcher sir’ ‘why what on earth does she do here’ said steerforth ‘it appears to be her native part of the country sir she informs me that she makes one of her professional visits here every year sir i met her in the street this afternoon and she wished to know if she might have the honour of waiting on you after dinner sir’ ‘do you know the giantess in question daisy’ inquired steerforth i was obliged to confessi felt ashamed even of being at this disadvantage before littimerthat miss mowcher and i were wholly unacquainted ‘then you shall know her’ said steerforth ‘for she is one of the seven wonders of the world when miss mowcher comes show her in’ i felt some curiosity and excitement about this lady especially as steerforth burst into a fit of laughing when i referred to her and positively refused to answer any question of which i made her the subject i remained therefore in a state of considerable expectation until the cloth had been removed some half an hour and we were sitting over our decanter of wine before the fire when the door opened and littimer with his habitual serenity quite undisturbed announced ‘miss mowcher’ i looked at the doorway and saw nothing i was still looking at the doorway thinking that miss mowcher was a long while making her appearance when to my infinite astonishment there came waddling round a sofa which stood between me and it a pursy dwarf of about forty or fortyfive with a very large head and face a pair of roguish grey eyes and such extremely little arms that to enable herself to lay a finger archly against her snub nose as she ogled steerforth she was obliged to meet the finger halfway and lay her nose against it her chin which was what is called a double chin was so fat that it entirely swallowed up the strings of her bonnet bow and all throat she had none waist she had none legs she had none worth mentioning for though she was more than fullsized down to where her waist would have been if she had had any and though she terminated as human beings generally do in a pair of feet she was so short that she stood at a commonsized chair as at a table resting a bag she carried on the seat this ladydressed in an offhand easy style bringing her nose and her forefinger together with the difficulty i have described standing with her head necessarily on one side and with one of her sharp eyes shut up making an uncommonly knowing faceafter ogling steerforth for a few moments broke into a torrent of words ‘what my flower’ she pleasantly began shaking her large head at him ‘you are there are you oh you naughty boy fie for shame what do you do so far away from home up to mischief i will be bound oh you are a downy fellow steerforth so you are and i am another are not i ha ha ha you would have betted a hundred pound to five now that you would not have seen me here would not you bless you man alive i am everywhere i am here and there and where not like the conjurer’s halfcrown in the lady’s handkercher talking of handkerchersand talking of ladieswhat a comfort you are to your blessed mother are not you my dear boy over one of my shoulders and i do not say which’ miss mowcher untied her bonnet at this passage of her discourse threw back the strings and sat down panting on a footstool in front of the firemaking a kind of arbour of the dining table which spread its mahogany shelter above her head ‘oh my stars and what istheirnames’ she went on clapping a hand on each of her little knees and glancing shrewdly at me ‘i am of too full a habit that is the fact steerforth after a flight of stairs it gives me as much trouble to draw every breath i want as if it was a bucket of water if you saw me looking out of an upper window you would think i was a fine woman would not you’ ‘i should think that wherever i saw you’ replied steerforth ‘go along you dog do’ cried the little creature making a whisk at him with the handkerchief with which she was wiping her face ‘and do not be impudent but i give you my word and honour i was at lady mithers’s last weekthere is a woman how she wearsand mithers himself came into the room where i was waiting for herthere is a man how he wears and his wig too for he is had it these ten yearsand he went on at that rate in the complimentary line that i began to think i should be obliged to ring the bell ha ha ha he is a pleasant wretch but he wants principle’ ‘what were you doing for lady mithers’ asked steerforth ‘that is tellings my blessed infant’ she retorted tapping her nose again screwing up her face and twinkling her eyes like an imp of supernatural intelligence ‘never you mind you would like to know whether i stop her hair from falling off or dye it or touch up her complexion or improve her eyebrows would not you and so you shall my darlingwhen i tell you do you know what my great grandfather’s name was’ ‘no’ said steerforth ‘it was walker my sweet pet’ replied miss mowcher ‘and he came of a long line of walkers that i inherit all the hookey estates from’ i never beheld anything approaching to miss mowcher’s wink except miss mowcher’s selfpossession she had a wonderful way too when listening to what was said to her or when waiting for an answer to what she had said herself of pausing with her head cunningly on one side and one eye turned up like a magpie’s altogether i was lost in amazement and sat staring at her quite oblivious i am afraid of the laws of politeness she had by this time drawn the chair to her side and was busily engaged in producing from the bag plunging in her short arm to the shoulder at every dive a number of small bottles sponges combs brushes bits of flannel little pairs of curlingirons and other instruments which she tumbled in a heap upon the chair from this employment she suddenly desisted and said to steerforth much to my confusion ‘who is your friend’ ‘mr copperfield’ said steerforth ‘he wants to know you’ ‘well then he shall i thought he looked as if he did’ returned miss mowcher waddling up to me bag in hand and laughing on me as she came ‘face like a peach’ standing on tiptoe to pinch my cheek as i sat ‘quite tempting i am very fond of peaches happy to make your acquaintance mr copperfield i am sure’ i said that i congratulated myself on having the honour to make hers and that the happiness was mutual ‘oh my goodness how polite we are’ exclaimed miss mowcher making a preposterous attempt to cover her large face with her morsel of a hand ‘what a world of gammon and spinnage it is though are not it’ this was addressed confidentially to both of us as the morsel of a hand came away from the face and buried itself arm and all in the bag again ‘what do you mean miss mowcher’ said steerforth ‘ha ha ha what a refreshing set of humbugs we are to be sure are not we my sweet child’ replied that morsel of a woman feeling in the bag with her head on one side and her eye in the air ‘look here’ taking something out ‘scraps of the russian prince’s nails prince alphabet turned topsyturvy i call him for his name’s got all the letters in it higgledypiggledy’ ‘the russian prince is a client of yours is he’ said steerforth ‘i believe you my pet’ replied miss mowcher ‘i keep his nails in order for him twice a week fingers and toes’ ‘he pays well i hope’ said steerforth ‘pays as he speaks my dear childthrough the nose’ replied miss mowcher ‘none of your close shavers the prince are not you would say so if you saw his moustachios red by nature black by art’ ‘by your art of course’ said steerforth miss mowcher winked assent ‘forced to send for me could not help it the climate affected his dye it did very well in russia but it was no go here you never saw such a rusty prince in all your born days as he was like old iron’ ‘is that why you called him a humbug just now’ inquired steerforth ‘oh you are a broth of a boy are not you’ returned miss mowcher shaking her head violently ‘i said what a set of humbugs we were in general and i showed you the scraps of the prince’s nails to prove it the prince’s nails do more for me in private families of the genteel sort than all my talents put together i always carry ‘them about they are the best introduction if miss mowcher cuts the prince’s nails she must be all right i give ‘them away to the young ladies they put ‘them in albums i believe ha ha ha upon my life “the whole social system” as the men call it when they make speeches in parliament is a system of prince’s nails’ said this least of women trying to fold her short arms and nodding her large head steerforth laughed heartily and i laughed too miss mowcher continuing all the time to shake her head which was very much on one side and to look into the air with one eye and to wink with the other ‘well well’ she said smiting her small knees and rising ‘this is not business come steerforth let us explore the polar regions and have it over’ she then selected two or three of the little instruments and a little bottle and asked to my surprise if the table would bear on steerforth’s replying in the affirmative she pushed a chair against it and begging the assistance of my hand mounted up pretty nimbly to the top as if it were a stage ‘if either of you saw my ankles’ she said when she was safely elevated ‘say so and i will go home and destroy myself’ ‘i did not’ said steerforth ‘i did not’ said i ‘well then’ cried miss mowcher ‘i will consent to live now ducky ducky ducky come to mrs bond and be killed’ this was an invitation to steerforth to place himself under her hands who accordingly sat himself down with his back to the table and his laughing face towards me and submitted his head to her inspection evidently for no other purpose than our entertainment to see miss mowcher standing over him looking at his rich profusion of brown hair through a large round magnifying glass which she took out of her pocket was a most amazing spectacle ‘you are a pretty fellow’ said miss mowcher after a brief inspection ‘you would be as bald as a friar on the top of your head in twelve months but for me just half a minute my young friend and we will give you a polishing that shall keep your curls on for the next ten years’ with this she tilted some of the contents of the little bottle on to one of the little bits of flannel and again imparting some of the virtues of that preparation to one of the little brushes began rubbing and scraping away with both on the crown of steerforth’s head in the busiest manner i ever witnessed talking all the time ‘there is charley pyegrave the duke’s son’ she said ‘you know charley’ peeping round into his face ‘a little’ said steerforth ‘what a man he is there is a whisker as to charley’s legs if they were only a pair which they are not they would defy competition would you believe he tried to do without mein the lifeguards too’ ‘mad’ said steerforth ‘it looks like it however mad or sane he tried’ returned miss mowcher ‘what does he do but lo and behold you he goes into a perfumer’s shop and wants to buy a bottle of the madagascar liquid’ ‘charley does’ said steerforth ‘charley does but they have not got any of the madagascar liquid’ ‘what is it something to drink’ asked steerforth ‘to drink’ returned miss mowcher stopping to slap his cheek ‘to doctor his own moustachios with you know there was a woman in the shopelderly femalequite a griffinwho had never even heard of it by name “begging pardon sir” said the griffin to charley “it is notnotnot rouge is it” “rouge” said charley to the griffin “what the unmentionable to ears polite do you think i want with rouge” “no offence sir” said the griffin “we have it asked for by so many names i thought it might be” now that my child’ continued miss mowcher rubbing all the time as busily as ever ‘is another instance of the refreshing humbug i was speaking of i do something in that way myselfperhaps a good dealperhaps a littlesharp’s the word my dear boynever mind’ ‘in what way do you mean in the rouge way’ said steerforth ‘put this and that together my tender pupil’ returned the wary mowcher touching her nose ‘work it by the rule of secrets in all trades and the product will give you the desired result i say i do a little in that way myself one dowager she calls it lipsalve another she calls it gloves another she calls it tuckeredging another she calls it a fan i call it whatever they call it i supply it for ‘them but we keep up the trick so to one another and make believe with such a face that they would as soon think of laying it on before a whole drawingroom as before me and when i wait upon ‘them they will say to me sometimeswith it onthick and no mistake“how am i looking mowcher am i pale” ha ha ha ha is not that refreshing my young friend’ i never did in my days behold anything like mowcher as she stood upon the dining table intensely enjoying this refreshment rubbing busily at steerforth’s head and winking at me over it ‘ah’ she said ‘such things are not much in demand hereabouts that sets me off again i have not seen a pretty woman since i have been here jemmy’ ‘no’ said steerforth ‘not the ghost of one’ replied miss mowcher ‘we could show her the substance of one i think’ said steerforth addressing his eyes to mine ‘eh daisy’ ‘yes indeed’ said i ‘aha’ cried the little creature glancing sharply at my face and then peeping round at steerforth’s ‘umph’ the first exclamation sounded like a question put to both of us and the second like a question put to steerforth only she seemed to have found no answer to either but continued to rub with her head on one side and her eye turned up as if she were looking for an answer in the air and were confident of its appearing presently ‘a sister of yours mr copperfield’ she cried after a pause and still keeping the same lookout ‘aye aye’ ‘no’ said steerforth before i could reply ‘nothing of the sort on the contrary mr copperfield usedor i am much mistakento have a great admiration for her’ ‘why has not he now’ returned miss mowcher ‘is he fickle oh for shame did he sip every flower and change every hour until polly his passion requitedis her name polly’ the elfin suddenness with which she pounced upon me with this question and a searching look quite disconcerted me for a moment ‘no miss mowcher’ i replied ‘her name is emily’ ‘aha’ she cried exactly as before ‘umph what a rattle i am mr copperfield are not i volatile’ her tone and look implied something that was not agreeable to me in connexion with the subject so i said in a graver manner than any of us had yet assumed ‘she is as virtuous as she is pretty she is engaged to be married to a most worthy and deserving man in her own station of life i esteem her for her good sense as much as i admire her for her good looks’ ‘well said’ cried steerforth ‘hear hear hear now i will quench the curiosity of this little fatima my dear daisy by leaving her nothing to guess at she is at present apprenticed miss mowcher or articled or whatever it may be to omer and joram haberdashers milliners and so forth in this town do you observe omer and joram the promise of which my friend has spoken is made and entered into with her cousin christian name ham surname peggotty occupation boatbuilder also of this town she lives with a relative christian name unknown surname peggotty occupation seafaring also of this town she is the prettiest and most engaging little fairy in the world i admire heras my friend doesexceedingly if it were not that i might appear to disparage her intended which i know my friend would not like i would add that to me she seems to be throwing herself away that i am sure she might do better and that i swear she was born to be a lady’ miss mowcher listened to these words which were very slowly and distinctly spoken with her head on one side and her eye in the air as if she were still looking for that answer when he ceased she became brisk again in an instant and rattled away with surprising volubility ‘oh and that is all about it is it’ she exclaimed trimming his whiskers with a little restless pair of scissors that went glancing round his head in all directions ‘very well very well quite a long story ought to end “and they lived happy ever afterwards” ought not it ah what is that game at forfeits i love my love with an e because she is enticing i hate her with an e because she is engaged i took her to the sign of the exquisite and treated her with an elopement her name’s emily and she lives in the east ha ha ha mr copperfield are not i volatile’ merely looking at me with extravagant slyness and not waiting for any reply she continued without drawing breath ‘there if ever any scapegrace was trimmed and touched up to perfection you are steerforth if i understand any noddle in the world i understand yours do you hear me when i tell you that my darling i understand yours’ peeping down into his face ‘now you may mizzle jemmy as we say at court and if mr copperfield will take the chair i will operate on him’ ‘what do you say daisy’ inquired steerforth laughing and resigning his seat ‘will you be improved’ ‘thank you miss mowcher not this evening’ ‘do not say no’ returned the little woman looking at me with the aspect of a connoisseur ‘a little bit more eyebrow’ ‘thank you’ i returned ‘some other time’ ‘have it carried half a quarter of an inch towards the temple’ said miss mowcher ‘we can do it in a fortnight’ ‘no i thank you not at present’ ‘go in for a tip’ she urged ‘no let us get the scaffolding up then for a pair of whiskers come’ i could not help blushing as i declined for i felt we were on my weak point now but miss mowcher finding that i was not at present disposed for any decoration within the range of her art and that i was for the time being proof against the blandishments of the small bottle which she held up before one eye to enforce her persuasions said we would make a beginning on an early day and requested the aid of my hand to descend from her elevated station thus assisted she skipped down with much agility and began to tie her double chin into her bonnet ‘the fee’ said steerforth ‘is’ ‘five bob’ replied miss mowcher ‘and dirt cheap my chicken are not i volatile mr copperfield’ i replied politely ‘not at all’ but i thought she was rather so when she tossed up his two halfcrowns like a goblin pieman caught them dropped them in her pocket and gave it a loud slap ‘that is the till’ observed miss mowcher standing at the chair again and replacing in the bag a miscellaneous collection of little objects she had emptied out of it ‘have i got all my traps it seems so it will not do to be like long ned beadwood when they took him to church “to marry him to somebody” as he says and left the bride behind ha ha ha a wicked rascal ned but droll now i know i am going to break your hearts but i am forced to leave you you must call up all your fortitude and try to bear it goodbye mr copperfield take care of yourself jockey of norfolk how i have been rattling on it is all the fault of you two wretches i forgive you “bob swore”as the englishman said for “good night” when he first learnt french and thought it so like english “bob swore” my ducks’ with the bag slung over her arm and rattling as she waddled away she waddled to the door where she stopped to inquire if she should leave us a lock of her hair ‘are not i volatile’ she added as a commentary on this offer and with her finger on her nose departed steerforth laughed to that degree that it was impossible for me to help laughing too though i am not sure i should have done so but for this inducement when we had had our laugh quite out which was after some time he told me that miss mowcher had quite an extensive connexion and made herself useful to a variety of people in a variety of ways some people trifled with her as a mere oddity he said but she was as shrewdly and sharply observant as anyone he knew and as longheaded as she was shortarmed he told me that what she had said of being here and there and everywhere was true enough for she made little darts into the provinces and seemed to pick up customers everywhere and to know everybody i asked him what her disposition was whether it was at all mischievous and if her sympathies were generally on the right side of things but not succeeding in attracting his attention to these questions after two or three attempts i forbore or forgot to repeat them he told me instead with much rapidity a good deal about her skill and her profits and about her being a scientific cupper if i should ever have occasion for her service in that capacity she was the principal theme of our conversation during the evening and when we parted for the night steerforth called after me over the banisters ‘bob swore’ as i went downstairs i was surprised when i came to mr barkis’s house to find ham walking up and down in front of it and still more surprised to learn from him that little them’ly was inside i naturally inquired why he was not there too instead of pacing the streets by himself ‘why you see mas’r davy’ he rejoined in a hesitating manner ‘them’ly she is talking to some ‘un in here’ ‘i should have thought’ said i smiling ‘that that was a reason for your being in here too ham’ ‘well mas’r davy in a general way so ‘t would be’ he returned ‘but look’ee here mas’r davy’ lowering his voice and speaking very gravely ‘it is a young woman sira young woman that them’ly knowed once and doen’t ought to know no more’ when i heard these words a light began to fall upon the figure i had seen following them some hours ago ‘it is a poor wurem mas’r davy’ said ham ‘as is trod under foot by all the town up street and down street the mowld of the churchyard do not hold any that the folk shrink away from more’ ‘did i see her tonight ham on the sand after we met you’ ‘keeping us in sight’ said ham ‘it is like you did mas’r davy not that i know’d then she was theer sir but along of her creeping soon arterwards under them’ly’s little winder when she see the light come and whispering “them’ly them’ly for christ’s sake have a woman’s heart towards me i was once like you” those was solemn words mas’r davy fur to hear’ ‘they were indeed ham what did them’ly do’ ‘says them’ly “martha is it you oh martha can it be you”for they had sat at work together many a day at mr omer’s’ ‘i recollect her now’ cried i recalling one of the two girls i had seen when i first went there ‘i recollect her quite well’ ‘martha endell’ said ham ‘two or three year older than them’ly but was at the school with her’ ‘i never heard her name’ said i ‘i did not mean to interrupt you’ ‘for the matter of that mas’r davy’ replied ham ‘all’s told a’most in them words “them’ly them’ly for christ’s sake have a woman’s heart towards me i was once like you” she wanted to speak to them’ly them’ly could not speak to her theer for her loving uncle was come home and he would notno mas’r davy’ said ham with great earnestness ‘he could not kindnatur’d tenderhearted as he is see them two together side by side for all the treasures that is wrecked in the sea’ i felt how true this was i knew it on the instant quite as well as ham ‘so them’ly writes in pencil on a bit of paper’ he pursued ‘and gives it to her out of winder to bring here “show that” she says “to my aunt mrs barkis and she will set you down by her fire for the love of me till uncle is gone out and i can come” by and by she tells me what i tell you mas’r davy and asks me to bring her what can i do she doen’t ought to know any such but i cannot deny her when the tears is on her face’ he put his hand into the breast of his shaggy jacket and took out with great care a pretty little purse ‘and if i could deny her when the tears was on her face mas’r davy’ said ham tenderly adjusting it on the rough palm of his hand ‘how could i deny her when she give me this to carry for herknowing what she brought it for such a toy as it is’ said ham thoughtfully looking on it ‘with such a little money in it them’ly my dear’ i shook him warmly by the hand when he had put it away againfor that was more satisfactory to me than saying anythingand we walked up and down for a minute or two in silence the door opened then and peggotty appeared beckoning to ham to come in i would have kept away but she came after me entreating me to come in too even then i would have avoided the room where they all were but for its being the neattiled kitchen i have mentioned more than once the door opening immediately into it i found myself among them before i considered whither i was going the girlthe same i had seen upon the sandswas near the fire she was sitting on the ground with her head and one arm lying on a chair i fancied from the disposition of her figure that them’ly had but newly risen from the chair and that the forlorn head might perhaps have been lying on her lap i saw but little of the girl’s face over which her hair fell loose and scattered as if she had been disordering it with her own hands but i saw that she was young and of a fair complexion peggotty had been crying so had little them’ly not a word was spoken when we first went in and the dutch clock by the dresser seemed in the silence to tick twice as loud as usual them’ly spoke first ‘martha wants’ she said to ham ‘to go to london’ ‘why to london’ returned ham he stood between them looking on the prostrate girl with a mixture of compassion for her and of jealousy of her holding any companionship with her whom he loved so well which i have always remembered distinctly they both spoke as if she were ill in a soft suppressed tone that was plainly heard although it hardly rose above a whisper ‘better there than here’ said a third voice aloudmartha’s though she did not move ‘no one knows me there everybody knows me here’ ‘what will she do there’ inquired ham she lifted up her head and looked darkly round at him for a moment then laid it down again and curved her right arm about her neck as a woman in a fever or in an agony of pain from a shot might twist herself ‘she will try to do well’ said little them’ly ‘you do not know what she has said to us does hedo theyaunt’ peggotty shook her head compassionately ‘i will try’ said martha ‘if you will help me away i never can do worse than i have done here i may do better oh’ with a dreadful shiver ‘take me out of these streets where the whole town knows me from a child’ as them’ly held out her hand to ham i saw him put in it a little canvas bag she took it as if she thought it were her purse and made a step or two forward but finding her mistake came back to where he had retired near me and showed it to him ‘it is all yourn them’ly’ i could hear him say ‘i have not nowt in all the wureld that are not yourn my dear it are not of no delight to me except for you’ the tears rose freshly in her eyes but she turned away and went to martha what she gave her i do not know i saw her stooping over her and putting money in her bosom she whispered something as she asked was that enough ‘more than enough’ the other said and took her hand and kissed it then martha arose and gathering her shawl about her covering her face with it and weeping aloud went slowly to the door she stopped a moment before going out as if she would have uttered something or turned back but no word passed her lips making the same low dreary wretched moaning in her shawl she went away as the door closed little them’ly looked at us three in a hurried manner and then hid her face in her hands and fell to sobbing ‘doen’t them’ly’ said ham tapping her gently on the shoulder ‘doen’t my dear you doen’t ought to cry so pretty’ ‘oh ham’ she exclaimed still weeping pitifully ‘i am not so good a girl as i ought to be i know i have not the thankful heart sometimes i ought to have’ ‘yes yes you have i am sure’ said ham ‘no no no’ cried little them’ly sobbing and shaking her head ‘i am not as good a girl as i ought to be not near not near’ and still she cried as if her heart would break ‘i try your love too much i know i do’ she sobbed ‘i am often cross to you and changeable with you when i ought to be far different you are never so to me why am i ever so to you when i should think of nothing but how to be grateful and to make you happy’ ‘you always make me so’ said ham ‘my dear i am happy in the sight of you i am happy all day long in the thoughts of you’ ‘ah that is not enough’ she cried ‘that is because you are good not because i am oh my dear it might have been a better fortune for you if you had been fond of someone elseof someone steadier and much worthier than me who was all bound up in you and never vain and changeable like me’ ‘poor little tenderheart’ said ham in a low voice ‘martha has overset her altogether’ ‘please aunt’ sobbed them’ly ‘come here and let me lay my head upon you oh i am very miserable tonight aunt oh i am not as good a girl as i ought to be i am not i know’ peggotty had hastened to the chair before the fire them’ly with her arms around her neck kneeled by her looking up most earnestly into her face ‘oh pray aunt try to help me ham dear try to help me mr david for the sake of old times do please try to help me i want to be a better girl than i am i want to feel a hundred times more thankful than i do i want to feel more what a blessed thing it is to be the wife of a good man and to lead a peaceful life oh me oh me oh my heart my heart’ she dropped her face on my old nurse’s breast and ceasing this supplication which in its agony and grief was half a woman’s half a child’s as all her manner was being in that more natural and better suited to her beauty as i thought than any other manner could have been wept silently while my old nurse hushed her like an infant she got calmer by degrees and then we soothed her now talking encouragingly and now jesting a little with her until she began to raise her head and speak to us so we got on until she was able to smile and then to laugh and then to sit up half ashamed while peggotty recalled her stray ringlets dried her eyes and made her neat again lest her uncle should wonder when she got home why his darling had been crying i saw her do that night what i had never seen her do before i saw her innocently kiss her chosen husband on the cheek and creep close to his bluff form as if it were her best support when they went away together in the waning moonlight and i looked after them comparing their departure in my mind with martha’s i saw that she held his arm with both her hands and still kept close to him
