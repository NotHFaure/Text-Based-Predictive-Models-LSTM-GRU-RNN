i corroborate mr dick and choose a profession when i awoke in the morning i thought very much of little them’ly and her emotion last night after martha had left i felt as if i had come into the knowledge of those domestic weaknesses and tendernesses in a sacred confidence and that to disclose them even to steerforth would be wrong i had no gentler feeling towards anyone than towards the pretty creature who had been my playmate and whom i have always been persuaded and shall always be persuaded to my dying day i then devotedly loved the repetition to any earseven to steerforth’sof what she had been unable to repress when her heart lay open to me by an accident i felt would be a rough deed unworthy of myself unworthy of the light of our pure childhood which i always saw encircling her head i made a resolution therefore to keep it in my own breast and there it gave her image a new grace while we were at breakfast a letter was delivered to me from my aunt as it contained matter on which i thought steerforth could advise me as well as anyone and on which i knew i should be delighted to consult him i resolved to make it a subject of discussion on our journey home for the present we had enough to do in taking leave of all our friends mr barkis was far from being the last among them in his regret at our departure and i believe would even have opened the box again and sacrificed another guinea if it would have kept us eightandforty hours in yarmouth peggotty and all her family were full of grief at our going the whole house of omer and joram turned out to bid us goodbye and there were so many seafaring volunteers in attendance on steerforth when our portmanteaux went to the coach that if we had had the baggage of a regiment with us we should hardly have wanted porters to carry it in a word we departed to the regret and admiration of all concerned and left a great many people very sorry behind us ‘do you stay long here littimer’ said i as he stood waiting to see the coach start ‘no sir’ he replied ‘probably not very long sir’ ‘he can hardly say just now’ observed steerforth carelessly ‘he knows what he has to do and he will do it’ ‘that i am sure he will’ said i littimer touched his hat in acknowledgement of my good opinion and i felt about eight years old he touched it once more wishing us a good journey and we left him standing on the pavement as respectable a mystery as any pyramid in egypt for some little time we held no conversation steerforth being unusually silent and i being sufficiently engaged in wondering within myself when i should see the old places again and what new changes might happen to me or them in the meanwhile at length steerforth becoming gay and talkative in a moment as he could become anything he liked at any moment pulled me by the arm ‘find a voice david what about that letter you were speaking of at breakfast’ ‘oh’ said i taking it out of my pocket ‘it is from my aunt’ ‘and what does she say requiring consideration’ ‘why she reminds me steerforth’ said i ‘that i came out on this expedition to look about me and to think a little’ ‘which of course you have done’ ‘indeed i cannot say i have particularly to tell you the truth i am afraid i have forgotten it’ ‘well look about you now and make up for your negligence’ said steerforth ‘look to the right and you will see a flat country with a good deal of marsh in it look to the left and you will see the same look to the front and you will find no difference look to the rear and there it is still’ i laughed and replied that i saw no suitable profession in the whole prospect which was perhaps to be attributed to its flatness ‘what says our aunt on the subject’ inquired steerforth glancing at the letter in my hand ‘does she suggest anything’ ‘why yes’ said i ‘she asks me here if i think i should like to be a proctor what do you think of it’ ‘well i do not know’ replied steerforth coolly ‘you may as well do that as anything else i suppose’ i could not help laughing again at his balancing all callings and professions so equally and i told him so ‘what is a proctor steerforth’ said i ‘why he is a sort of monkish attorney’ replied steerforth ‘he is to some faded courts held in doctors’ commonsa lazy old nook near st paul’s churchyardwhat solicitors are to the courts of law and equity he is a functionary whose existence in the natural course of things would have terminated about two hundred years ago i can tell you best what he is by telling you what doctors’ commons is it is a little outoftheway place where they administer what is called ecclesiastical law and play all kinds of tricks with obsolete old monsters of acts of parliament which threefourths of the world know nothing about and the other fourth supposes to have been dug up in a fossil state in the days of the edwards it is a place that has an ancient monopoly in suits about people’s wills and people’s marriages and disputes among ships and boats’ ‘nonsense steerforth’ i exclaimed ‘you do not mean to say that there is any affinity between nautical matters and ecclesiastical matters’ ‘i do not indeed my dear boy’ he returned ‘but i mean to say that they are managed and decided by the same set of people down in that same doctors’ commons you shall go there one day and find them blundering through half the nautical terms in young’s dictionary apropos of the “nancy” having run down the “sarah jane” or mr peggotty and the yarmouth boatmen having put off in a gale of wind with an anchor and cable to the “nelson” indiaman in distress and you shall go there another day and find them deep in the evidence pro and con respecting a clergyman who has misbehaved himself and you shall find the judge in the nautical case the advocate in the clergyman’s case or contrariwise they are like actors now a man’s a judge and now he is not a judge now he is one thing now he is another now he is something else change and change about but it is always a very pleasant profitable little affair of private theatricals presented to an uncommonly select audience’ ‘but advocates and proctors are not one and the same’ said i a little puzzled ‘are they’ ‘no’ returned steerforth ‘the advocates are civiliansmen who have taken a doctor’s degree at collegewhich is the first reason of my knowing anything about it the proctors employ the advocates both get very comfortable fees and altogether they make a mighty snug little party on the whole i would recommend you to take to doctors’ commons kindly david they plume themselves on their gentility there i can tell you if that is any satisfaction’ i made allowance for steerforth’s light way of treating the subject and considering it with reference to the staid air of gravity and antiquity which i associated with that ‘lazy old nook near st paul’s churchyard’ did not feel indisposed towards my aunt’s suggestion which she left to my free decision making no scruple of telling me that it had occurred to her on her lately visiting her own proctor in doctors’ commons for the purpose of settling her will in my favour ‘that is a laudable proceeding on the part of our aunt at all events’ said steerforth when i mentioned it ‘and one deserving of all encouragement daisy my advice is that you take kindly to doctors’ commons’ i quite made up my mind to do so i then told steerforth that my aunt was in town awaiting me as i found from her letter and that she had taken lodgings for a week at a kind of private hotel at lincoln’s inn fields where there was a stone staircase and a convenient door in the roof my aunt being firmly persuaded that every house in london was going to be burnt down every night we achieved the rest of our journey pleasantly sometimes recurring to doctors’ commons and anticipating the distant days when i should be a proctor there which steerforth pictured in a variety of humorous and whimsical lights that made us both merry when we came to our journey’s end he went home engaging to call upon me next day but one and i drove to lincoln’s inn fields where i found my aunt up and waiting supper if i had been round the world since we parted we could hardly have been better pleased to meet again my aunt cried outright as she embraced me and said pretending to laugh that if my poor mother had been alive that silly little creature would have she would tears she had no doubt ‘so you have left mr dick behind aunt’ said i ‘i am sorry for that ah janet how do you do’ as janet curtsied hoping i was well i observed my aunt’s visage lengthen very much ‘i am sorry for it too’ said my aunt rubbing her nose ‘i have had no peace of mind trot since i have been here’ before i could ask why she told me ‘i am convinced’ said my aunt laying her hand with melancholy firmness on the table ‘that dick’s character is not a character to keep the donkeys off i am confident he wants strength of purpose i ought to have left janet at home instead and then my mind might perhaps have been at ease if ever there was a donkey trespassing on my green’ said my aunt with emphasis ‘there was one this afternoon at four of the clock a cold feeling came over me from head to foot and i know it was a donkey’ i tried to comfort her on this point but she rejected consolation ‘it was a donkey’ said my aunt ‘and it was the one with the stumpy tail which that murdering sister of a woman rode when she came to my house’ this had been ever since the only name my aunt knew for miss murdstone ‘if there is any donkey in dover whose audacity it is harder to me to bear than another’s that’ said my aunt striking the table ‘is the animal’ janet ventured to suggest that my aunt might be disturbing herself unnecessarily and that she believed the donkey in question was then engaged in the sandandgravel line of business and was not available for purposes of trespass but my aunt would not hear of it supper was comfortably served and hot though my aunt’s rooms were very high upwhether that she might have more stone stairs for her money or might be nearer to the door in the roof i do not knowand consisted of a roast fowl a steak and some vegetables to all of which i did ample justice and which were all excellent but my aunt had her own ideas concerning london provision and ate but little ‘i suppose this unfortunate fowl was born and brought up in a cellar’ said my aunt ‘and never took the air except on a hackney coachstand i hope the steak may be beef but i do not believe it nothing’s genuine in the place in my opinion but the dirt’ ‘do not you think the fowl may have come out of the country aunt’ i hinted ‘certainly not’ returned my aunt ‘it would be no pleasure to a london tradesman to sell anything which was what he pretended it was’ i did not venture to controvert this opinion but i made a good supper which it greatly satisfied her to see me do when the table was cleared janet assisted her to arrange her hair to put on her nightcap which was of a smarter construction than usual ‘in case of fire’ my aunt said and to fold her gown back over her knees these being her usual preparations for warming herself before going to bed i then made her according to certain established regulations from which no deviation however slight could ever be permitted a glass of hot wine and water and a slice of toast cut into long thin strips with these accompaniments we were left alone to finish the evening my aunt sitting opposite to me drinking her wine and water soaking her strips of toast in it one by one before eating them and looking benignantly on me from among the borders of her nightcap ‘well trot’ she began ‘what do you think of the proctor plan or have you not begun to think about it yet’ ‘i have thought a good deal about it my dear aunt and i have talked a good deal about it with steerforth i like it very much indeed i like it exceedingly’ ‘come’ said my aunt ‘that is cheering’ ‘i have only one difficulty aunt’ ‘say what it is trot’ she returned ‘why i want to ask aunt as this seems from what i understand to be a limited profession whether my entrance into it would not be very expensive’ ‘it will cost’ returned my aunt ‘to article you just a thousand pounds’ ‘now my dear aunt’ said i drawing my chair nearer ‘i am uneasy in my mind about that it is a large sum of money you have expended a great deal on my education and have always been as liberal to me in all things as it was possible to be you have been the soul of generosity surely there are some ways in which i might begin life with hardly any outlay and yet begin with a good hope of getting on by resolution and exertion are you sure that it would not be better to try that course are you certain that you can afford to part with so much money and that it is right that it should be so expended i only ask you my second mother to consider are you certain’ my aunt finished eating the piece of toast on which she was then engaged looking me full in the face all the while and then setting her glass on the chimneypiece and folding her hands upon her folded skirts replied as follows ‘trot my child if i have any object in life it is to provide for your being a good a sensible and a happy man i am bent upon itso is dick i should like some people that i know to hear dick’s conversation on the subject its sagacity is wonderful but no one knows the resources of that man’s intellect except myself’ she stopped for a moment to take my hand between hers and went on ‘it is in vain trot to recall the past unless it works some influence upon the present perhaps i might have been better friends with your poor father perhaps i might have been better friends with that poor child your mother even after your sister betsey trotwood disappointed me when you came to me a little runaway boy all dusty and wayworn perhaps i thought so from that time until now trot you have ever been a credit to me and a pride and a pleasure i have no other claim upon my means at least’here to my surprise she hesitated and was confused‘no i have no other claim upon my meansand you are my adopted child only be a loving child to me in my age and bear with my whims and fancies and you will do more for an old woman whose prime of life was not so happy or conciliating as it might have been than ever that old woman did for you’ it was the first time i had heard my aunt refer to her past history there was a magnanimity in her quiet way of doing so and of dismissing it which would have exalted her in my respect and affection if anything could ‘all is agreed and understood between us now trot’ said my aunt ‘and we need talk of this no more give me a kiss and we will go to the commons after breakfast tomorrow’ we had a long chat by the fire before we went to bed i slept in a room on the same floor with my aunt’s and was a little disturbed in the course of the night by her knocking at my door as often as she was agitated by a distant sound of hackneycoaches or marketcarts and inquiring ‘if i heard the engines’ but towards morning she slept better and suffered me to do so too at about midday we set out for the office of messrs spenlow and jorkins in doctors’ commons my aunt who had this other general opinion in reference to london that every man she saw was a pickpocket gave me her purse to carry for her which had ten guineas in it and some silver we made a pause at the toy shop in fleet street to see the giants of saint dunstan’s strike upon the bellswe had timed our going so as to catch them at it at twelve of the clockand then went on towards ludgate hill and st paul’s churchyard we were crossing to the former place when i found that my aunt greatly accelerated her speed and looked frightened i observed at the same time that a lowering illdressed man who had stopped and stared at us in passing a little before was coming so close after us as to brush against her ‘trot my dear trot’ cried my aunt in a terrified whisper and pressing my arm ‘i do not know what i am to do’ ‘do not be alarmed’ said i ‘there is nothing to be afraid of step into a shop and i will soon get rid of this fellow’ ‘no no child’ she returned ‘do not speak to him for the world i entreat i order you’ ‘good heaven aunt’ said i ‘he is nothing but a sturdy beggar’ ‘you do not know what he is’ replied my aunt ‘you do not know who he is you do not know what you say’ we had stopped in an empty doorway while this was passing and he had stopped too ‘do not look at him’ said my aunt as i turned my head indignantly ‘but get me a coach my dear and wait for me in st paul’s churchyard’ ‘wait for you’ i replied ‘yes’ rejoined my aunt ‘i must go alone i must go with him’ ‘with him aunt this man’ ‘i am in my senses’ she replied ‘and i tell you i must get me a coach’ however much astonished i might be i was sensible that i had no right to refuse compliance with such a peremptory command i hurried away a few paces and called a hackneychariot which was passing empty almost before i could let down the steps my aunt sprang in i do not know how and the man followed she waved her hand to me to go away so earnestly that all confounded as i was i turned from them at once in doing so i heard her say to the coachman ‘drive anywhere drive straight on’ and presently the chariot passed me going up the hill what mr dick had told me and what i had supposed to be a delusion of his now came into my mind i could not doubt that this person was the person of whom he had made such mysterious mention though what the nature of his hold upon my aunt could possibly be i was quite unable to imagine after half an hour’s cooling in the churchyard i saw the chariot coming back the driver stopped beside me and my aunt was sitting in it alone she had not yet sufficiently recovered from her agitation to be quite prepared for the visit we had to make she desired me to get into the chariot and to tell the coachman to drive slowly up and down a little while she said no more except ‘my dear child never ask me what it was and do not refer to it’ until she had perfectly regained her composure when she told me she was quite herself now and we might get out on her giving me her purse to pay the driver i found that all the guineas were gone and only the loose silver remained doctors’ commons was approached by a little low archway before we had taken many paces down the street beyond it the noise of the city seemed to melt as if by magic into a softened distance a few dull courts and narrow ways brought us to the skylighted offices of spenlow and jorkins in the vestibule of which temple accessible to pilgrims without the ceremony of knocking three or four clerks were at work as copyists one of these a little dry man sitting by himself who wore a stiff brown wig that looked as if it were made of gingerbread rose to receive my aunt and show us into mr spenlow’s room ‘mr spenlow’s in court madam’ said the dry man ‘it is an arches day but it is close by and i will send for him directly’ as we were left to look about us while mr spenlow was fetched i availed myself of the opportunity the furniture of the room was oldfashioned and dusty and the green baize on the top of the writingtable had lost all its colour and was as withered and pale as an old pauper there were a great many bundles of papers on it some endorsed as allegations and some to my surprise as libels and some as being in the consistory court and some in the arches court and some in the prerogative court and some in the admiralty court and some in the delegates’ court giving me occasion to wonder much how many courts there might be in the gross and how long it would take to understand them all besides these there were sundry immense manuscript books of evidence taken on affidavit strongly bound and tied together in massive sets a set to each because as if every because were a history in ten or twenty volumes all this looked tolerably expensive i thought and gave me an agreeable notion of a proctor’s business i was casting my eyes with increasing complacency over these and many similar objects when hasty footsteps were heard in the room outside and mr spenlow in a black gown trimmed with white fur came hurrying in taking off his hat as he came he was a little lighthaired gentleman with undeniable boots and the stiffest of white cravats and shirtcollars he was buttoned up mighty trim and tight and must have taken a great deal of pains with his whiskers which were accurately curled his gold watchchain was so massive that a fancy came across me that he ought to have a sinewy golden arm to draw it out with like those which are put up over the goldbeaters’ shops he was got up with such care and was so stiff that he could hardly bend himself being obliged when he glanced at some papers on his desk after sitting down in his chair to move his whole body from the bottom of his spine like punch i had previously been presented by my aunt and had been courteously received he now said ‘and so mr copperfield you think of entering into our profession i casually mentioned to miss trotwood when i had the pleasure of an interview with her the other day’with another inclination of his bodypunch again‘that there was a vacancy here miss trotwood was good enough to mention that she had a nephew who was her peculiar care and for whom she was seeking to provide genteelly in life that nephew i believe i have now the pleasure of’punch again i bowed my acknowledgements and said my aunt had mentioned to me that there was that opening and that i believed i should like it very much that i was strongly inclined to like it and had taken immediately to the proposal that i could not absolutely pledge myself to like it until i knew something more about it that although it was little else than a matter of form i presumed i should have an opportunity of trying how i liked it before i bound myself to it irrevocably ‘oh surely surely’ said mr spenlow ‘we always in this house propose a monthan initiatory month i should be happy myself to propose two monthsthreean indefinite period in factbut i have a partner mr jorkins’ ‘and the premium sir’ i returned ‘is a thousand pounds’ ‘and the premium stamp included is a thousand pounds’ said mr spenlow ‘as i have mentioned to miss trotwood i am actuated by no mercenary considerations few men are less so i believe but mr jorkins has his opinions on these subjects and i am bound to respect mr jorkins’s opinions mr jorkins thinks a thousand pounds too little in short’ ‘i suppose sir’ said i still desiring to spare my aunt ‘that it is not the custom here if an articled clerk were particularly useful and made himself a perfect master of his profession’i could not help blushing this looked so like praising myself‘i suppose it is not the custom in the later years of his time to allow him any’ mr spenlow by a great effort just lifted his head far enough out of his cravat to shake it and answered anticipating the word ‘salary’ ‘no i will not say what consideration i might give to that point myself mr copperfield if i were unfettered mr jorkins is immovable’ i was quite dismayed by the idea of this terrible jorkins but i found out afterwards that he was a mild man of a heavy temperament whose place in the business was to keep himself in the background and be constantly exhibited by name as the most obdurate and ruthless of men if a clerk wanted his salary raised mr jorkins would not listen to such a proposition if a client were slow to settle his bill of costs mr jorkins was resolved to have it paid and however painful these things might be and always were to the feelings of mr spenlow mr jorkins would have his bond the heart and hand of the good angel spenlow would have been always open but for the restraining demon jorkins as i have grown older i think i have had experience of some other houses doing business on the principle of spenlow and jorkins it was settled that i should begin my month’s probation as soon as i pleased and that my aunt need neither remain in town nor return at its expiration as the articles of agreement of which i was to be the subject could easily be sent to her at home for her signature when we had got so far mr spenlow offered to take me into court then and there and show me what sort of place it was as i was willing enough to know we went out with this object leaving my aunt behind who would trust herself she said in no such place and who i think regarded all courts of law as a sort of powdermills that might blow up at any time mr spenlow conducted me through a paved courtyard formed of grave brick houses which i inferred from the doctors’ names upon the doors to be the official abidingplaces of the learned advocates of whom steerforth had told me and into a large dull room not unlike a chapel to my thinking on the left hand the upper part of this room was fenced off from the rest and there on the two sides of a raised platform of the horseshoe form sitting on easy oldfashioned diningroom chairs were sundry gentlemen in red gowns and grey wigs whom i found to be the doctors aforesaid blinking over a little desk like a pulpitdesk in the curve of the horseshoe was an old gentleman whom if i had seen him in an aviary i should certainly have taken for an owl but who i learned was the presiding judge in the space within the horseshoe lower than these that is to say on about the level of the floor were sundry other gentlemen of mr spenlow’s rank and dressed like him in black gowns with white fur upon them sitting at a long green table their cravats were in general stiff i thought and their looks haughty but in this last respect i presently conceived i had done them an injustice for when two or three of them had to rise and answer a question of the presiding dignitary i never saw anything more sheepish the public represented by a boy with a comforter and a shabbygenteel man secretly eating crumbs out of his coat pockets was warming itself at a stove in the centre of the court the languid stillness of the place was only broken by the chirping of this fire and by the voice of one of the doctors who was wandering slowly through a perfect library of evidence and stopping to put up from time to time at little roadside inns of argument on the journey altogether i have never on any occasion made one at such a cosey dosey oldfashioned timeforgotten sleepyheaded little familyparty in all my life and i felt it would be quite a soothing opiate to belong to it in any characterexcept perhaps as a suitor very well satisfied with the dreamy nature of this retreat i informed mr spenlow that i had seen enough for that time and we rejoined my aunt in company with whom i presently departed from the commons feeling very young when i went out of spenlow and jorkins’s on account of the clerks poking one another with their pens to point me out we arrived at lincoln’s inn fields without any new adventures except encountering an unlucky donkey in a costermonger’s cart who suggested painful associations to my aunt we had another long talk about my plans when we were safely housed and as i knew she was anxious to get home and between fire food and pickpockets could never be considered at her ease for halfanhour in london i urged her not to be uncomfortable on my account but to leave me to take care of myself ‘i have not been here a week tomorrow without considering that too my dear’ she returned ‘there is a furnished little set of chambers to be let in the adelphi trot which ought to suit you to a marvel’ with this brief introduction she produced from her pocket an advertisement carefully cut out of a newspaper setting forth that in buckingham street in the adelphi there was to be let furnished with a view of the river a singularly desirable and compact set of chambers forming a genteel residence for a young gentleman a member of one of the inns of court or otherwise with immediate possession terms moderate and could be taken for a month only if required ‘why this is the very thing aunt’ said i flushed with the possible dignity of living in chambers ‘then come’ replied my aunt immediately resuming the bonnet she had a minute before laid aside ‘we will go and look at ‘them’ away we went the advertisement directed us to apply to mrs crupp on the premises and we rung the area bell which we supposed to communicate with mrs crupp it was not until we had rung three or four times that we could prevail on mrs crupp to communicate with us but at last she appeared being a stout lady with a flounce of flannel petticoat below a nankeen gown ‘let us see these chambers of yours if you please madam’ said my aunt ‘for this gentleman’ said mrs crupp feeling in her pocket for her keys ‘yes for my nephew’ said my aunt ‘and a sweet set they is for sich’ said mrs crupp so we went upstairs they were on the top of the housea great point with my aunt being near the fireescapeand consisted of a little halfblind entry where you could see hardly anything a little stoneblind pantry where you could see nothing at all a sittingroom and a bedroom the furniture was rather faded but quite good enough for me and sure enough the river was outside the windows as i was delighted with the place my aunt and mrs crupp withdrew into the pantry to discuss the terms while i remained on the sittingroom sofa hardly daring to think it possible that i could be destined to live in such a noble residence after a single combat of some duration they returned and i saw to my joy both in mrs crupp’s countenance and in my aunt’s that the deed was done ‘is it the last occupant’s furniture’ inquired my aunt ‘yes it is madam’ said mrs crupp ‘what is become of him’ asked my aunt mrs crupp was taken with a troublesome cough in the midst of which she articulated with much difficulty ‘he was took ill here madam andugh ugh ugh dear meand he died’ ‘hey what did he die of’ asked my aunt ‘well madam he died of drink’ said mrs crupp in confidence ‘and smoke’ ‘smoke you do not mean chimneys’ said my aunt ‘no madam’ returned mrs crupp ‘cigars and pipes’ ‘that is not catching trot at any rate’ remarked my aunt turning to me ‘no indeed’ said i in short my aunt seeing how enraptured i was with the premises took them for a month with leave to remain for twelve months when that time was out mrs crupp was to find linen and to cook every other necessary was already provided and mrs crupp expressly intimated that she should always yearn towards me as a son i was to take possession the day after tomorrow and mrs crupp said thank heaven she had now found summun she could care for on our way back my aunt informed me how she confidently trusted that the life i was now to lead would make me firm and selfreliant which was all i wanted she repeated this several times next day in the intervals of our arranging for the transmission of my clothes and books from mr wickfield’s relative to which and to all my late holiday i wrote a long letter to agnes of which my aunt took charge as she was to leave on the succeeding day not to lengthen these particulars i need only add that she made a handsome provision for all my possible wants during my month of trial that steerforth to my great disappointment and hers too did not make his appearance before she went away that i saw her safely seated in the dover coach exulting in the coming discomfiture of the vagrant donkeys with janet at her side and that when the coach was gone i turned my face to the adelphi pondering on the old days when i used to roam about its subterranean arches and on the happy changes which had brought me to the surface
