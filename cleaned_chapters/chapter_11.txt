i begin life on my own account and do not like it i know enough of the world now to have almost lost the capacity of being much surprised by anything but it is matter of some surprise to me even now that i can have been so easily thrown away at such an age a child of excellent abilities and with strong powers of observation quick eager delicate and soon hurt bodily or mentally it seems wonderful to me that nobody should have made any sign in my behalf but none was made and i became at ten years old a little labouring hind in the service of murdstone and grinby murdstone and grinby’s warehouse was at the waterside it was down in blackfriars modern improvements have altered the place but it was the last house at the bottom of a narrow street curving down hill to the river with some stairs at the end where people took boat it was a crazy old house with a wharf of its own abutting on the water when the tide was in and on the mud when the tide was out and literally overrun with rats its panelled rooms discoloured with the dirt and smoke of a hundred years i dare say its decaying floors and staircase the squeaking and scuffling of the old grey rats down in the cellars and the dirt and rottenness of the place are things not of many years ago in my mind but of the present instant they are all before me just as they were in the evil hour when i went among them for the first time with my trembling hand in mr quinion’s murdstone and grinby’s trade was among a good many kinds of people but an important branch of it was the supply of wines and spirits to certain packet ships i forget now where they chiefly went but i think there were some among them that made voyages both to the east and west indies i know that a great many empty bottles were one of the consequences of this traffic and that certain men and boys were employed to examine them against the light and reject those that were flawed and to rinse and wash them when the empty bottles ran short there were labels to be pasted on full ones or corks to be fitted to them or seals to be put upon the corks or finished bottles to be packed in casks all this work was my work and of the boys employed upon it i was one there were three or four of us counting me my working place was established in a corner of the warehouse where mr quinion could see me when he chose to stand up on the bottom rail of his stool in the countinghouse and look at me through a window above the desk hither on the first morning of my so auspiciously beginning life on my own account the oldest of the regular boys was summoned to show me my business his name was mick walker and he wore a ragged apron and a paper cap he informed me that his father was a bargeman and walked in a black velvet headdress in the lord mayor’s show he also informed me that our principal associate would be another boy whom he introduced by theto meextraordinary name of mealy potatoes i discovered however that this youth had not been christened by that name but that it had been bestowed upon him in the warehouse on account of his complexion which was pale or mealy mealy’s father was a waterman who had the additional distinction of being a fireman and was engaged as such at one of the large theatres where some young relation of mealy’si think his little sisterdid imps in the pantomimes no words can express the secret agony of my soul as i sunk into this companionship compared these henceforth everyday associates with those of my happier childhoodnot to say with steerforth traddles and the rest of those boys and felt my hopes of growing up to be a learned and distinguished man crushed in my bosom the deep remembrance of the sense i had of being utterly without hope now of the shame i felt in my position of the misery it was to my young heart to believe that day by day what i had learned and thought and delighted in and raised my fancy and my emulation up by would pass away from me little by little never to be brought back any more cannot be written as often as mick walker went away in the course of that forenoon i mingled my tears with the water in which i was washing the bottles and sobbed as if there were a flaw in my own breast and it were in danger of bursting the countinghouse clock was at half past twelve and there was general preparation for going to dinner when mr quinion tapped at the countinghouse window and beckoned to me to go in i went in and found there a stoutish middleaged person in a brown surtout and black tights and shoes with no more hair upon his head which was a large one and very shining than there is upon an egg and with a very extensive face which he turned full upon me his clothes were shabby but he had an imposing shirtcollar on he carried a jaunty sort of a stick with a large pair of rusty tassels to it and a quizzingglass hung outside his coatfor ornament i afterwards found as he very seldom looked through it and could not see anything when he did ‘this’ said mr quinion in allusion to myself ‘is he’ ‘this’ said the stranger with a certain condescending roll in his voice and a certain indescribable air of doing something genteel which impressed me very much ‘is master copperfield i hope i see you well sir’ i said i was very well and hoped he was i was sufficiently ill at ease heaven knows but it was not in my nature to complain much at that time of my life so i said i was very well and hoped he was ‘i am’ said the stranger ‘thank heaven quite well i have received a letter from mr murdstone in which he mentions that he would desire me to receive into an apartment in the rear of my house which is at present unoccupiedand is in short to be let as ain short’ said the stranger with a smile and in a burst of confidence ‘as a bedroomthe young beginner whom i have now the pleasure to’ and the stranger waved his hand and settled his chin in his shirtcollar ‘this is mr micawber’ said mr quinion to me ‘ahem’ said the stranger ‘that is my name’ ‘mr micawber’ said mr quinion ‘is known to mr murdstone he takes orders for us on commission when he can get any he has been written to by mr murdstone on the subject of your lodgings and he will receive you as a lodger’ ‘my address’ said mr micawber ‘is windsor terrace city road iin short’ said mr micawber with the same genteel air and in another burst of confidence‘i live there’ i made him a bow ‘under the impression’ said mr micawber ‘that your peregrinations in this metropolis have not as yet been extensive and that you might have some difficulty in penetrating the arcana of the modern babylon in the direction of the city roadin short’ said mr micawber in another burst of confidence ‘that you might lose yourselfi shall be happy to call this evening and install you in the knowledge of the nearest way’ i thanked him with all my heart for it was friendly in him to offer to take that trouble ‘at what hour’ said mr micawber ‘shall i’ ‘at about eight’ said mr quinion ‘at about eight’ said mr micawber ‘i beg to wish you good day mr quinion i will intrude no longer’ so he put on his hat and went out with his cane under his arm very upright and humming a tune when he was clear of the countinghouse mr quinion then formally engaged me to be as useful as i could in the warehouse of murdstone and grinby at a salary i think of six shillings a week i am not clear whether it was six or seven i am inclined to believe from my uncertainty on this head that it was six at first and seven afterwards he paid me a week down from his own pocket i believe and i gave mealy sixpence out of it to get my trunk carried to windsor terrace that night it being too heavy for my strength small as it was i paid sixpence more for my dinner which was a meat pie and a turn at a neighbouring pump and passed the hour which was allowed for that meal in walking about the streets at the appointed time in the evening mr micawber reappeared i washed my hands and face to do the greater honour to his gentility and we walked to our house as i suppose i must now call it together mr micawber impressing the name of streets and the shapes of corner houses upon me as we went along that i might find my way back easily in the morning arrived at this house in windsor terrace which i noticed was shabby like himself but also like himself made all the show it could he presented me to mrs micawber a thin and faded lady not at all young who was sitting in the parlour the first floor was altogether unfurnished and the blinds were kept down to delude the neighbours with a baby at her breast this baby was one of twins and i may remark here that i hardly ever in all my experience of the family saw both the twins detached from mrs micawber at the same time one of them was always taking refreshment there were two other children master micawber aged about four and miss micawber aged about three these and a darkcomplexioned young woman with a habit of snorting who was servant to the family and informed me before half an hour had expired that she was ‘a orfling’ and came from st luke’s workhouse in the neighbourhood completed the establishment my room was at the top of the house at the back a close chamber stencilled all over with an ornament which my young imagination represented as a blue muffin and very scantily furnished ‘i never thought’ said mrs micawber when she came up twin and all to show me the apartment and sat down to take breath ‘before i was married when i lived with papa and mama that i should ever find it necessary to take a lodger but mr micawber being in difficulties all considerations of private feeling must give way’ i said ‘yes madam’ ‘mr micawber’s difficulties are almost overwhelming just at present’ said mrs micawber ‘and whether it is possible to bring him through them i do not know when i lived at home with papa and mama i really should have hardly understood what the word meant in the sense in which i now employ it but experientia does itas papa used to say’ i cannot satisfy myself whether she told me that mr micawber had been an officer in the marines or whether i have imagined it i only know that i believe to this hour that he was in the marines once upon a time without knowing why he was a sort of town traveller for a number of miscellaneous houses now but made little or nothing of it i am afraid ‘if mr micawber’s creditors will not give him time’ said mrs micawber ‘they must take the consequences and the sooner they bring it to an issue the better blood cannot be obtained from a stone neither can anything on account be obtained at present not to mention law expenses from mr micawber’ i never can quite understand whether my precocious selfdependence confused mrs micawber in reference to my age or whether she was so full of the subject that she would have talked about it to the very twins if there had been nobody else to communicate with but this was the strain in which she began and she went on accordingly all the time i knew her poor mrs micawber she said she had tried to exert herself and so i have no doubt she had the centre of the street door was perfectly covered with a great brassplate on which was engraved ‘mrs micawber’s boarding establishment for young ladies’ but i never found that any young lady had ever been to school there or that any young lady ever came or proposed to come or that the least preparation was ever made to receive any young lady the only visitors i ever saw or heard of were creditors they used to come at all hours and some of them were quite ferocious one dirtyfaced man i think he was a bootmaker used to edge himself into the passage as early as seven of the clock in the morning and call up the stairs to mr micawber‘come you are not out yet you know pay us will you do not hide you know that is mean i would not be mean if i was you pay us will you you just pay us d’ye hear come’ receiving no answer to these taunts he would mount in his wrath to the words ‘swindlers’ and ‘robbers’ and these being ineffectual too would sometimes go to the extremity of crossing the street and roaring up at the windows of the second floor where he knew mr micawber was at these times mr micawber would be transported with grief and mortification even to the length as i was once made aware by a scream from his wife of making motions at himself with a razor but within halfanhour afterwards he would polish up his shoes with extraordinary pains and go out humming a tune with a greater air of gentility than ever mrs micawber was quite as elastic i have known her to be thrown into fainting fits by the king’s taxes at three of the clock and to eat lamb chops breaded and drink warm ale paid for with two teaspoons that had gone to the pawnbroker’s at four on one occasion when an execution had just been put in coming home through some chance as early as six of the clock i saw her lying of course with a twin under the grate in a swoon with her hair all torn about her face but i never knew her more cheerful than she was that very same night over a veal cutlet before the kitchen fire telling me stories about her papa and mama and the company they used to keep in this house and with this family i passed my leisure time my own exclusive breakfast of a penny loaf and a pennyworth of milk i provided myself i kept another small loaf and a modicum of cheese on a particular shelf of a particular cupboard to make my supper on when i came back at night this made a hole in the six or seven shillings i know well and i was out at the warehouse all day and had to support myself on that money all the week from monday morning until saturday night i had no advice no counsel no encouragement no consolation no assistance no support of any kind from anyone that i can call to mind as i hope to go to heaven i was so young and childish and so little qualifiedhow could i be otherwiseto undertake the whole charge of my own existence that often in going to murdstone and grinby’s of a morning i could not resist the stale pastry put out for sale at halfprice at the pastrycooks’ doors and spent in that the money i should have kept for my dinner then i went without my dinner or bought a roll or a slice of pudding i remember two pudding shops between which i was divided according to my finances one was in a court close to st martin’s churchat the back of the churchwhich is now removed altogether the pudding at that shop was made of currants and was rather a special pudding but was dear twopennyworth not being larger than a pennyworth of more ordinary pudding a good shop for the latter was in the strandsomewhere in that part which has been rebuilt since it was a stout pale pudding heavy and flabby and with great flat raisins in it stuck in whole at wide distances apart it came up hot at about my time every day and many a day did i dine off it when i dined regularly and handsomely i had a saveloy and a penny loaf or a fourpenny plate of red beef from a cook’s shop or a plate of bread and cheese and a glass of beer from a miserable old publichouse opposite our place of business called the lion or the lion and something else that i have forgotten once i remember carrying my own bread which i had brought from home in the morning under my arm wrapped in a piece of paper like a book and going to a famous alamode beefhouse near drury lane and ordering a ‘small plate’ of that delicacy to eat with it what the waiter thought of such a strange little apparition coming in all alone i do not know but i can see him now staring at me as i ate my dinner and bringing up the other waiter to look i gave him a halfpenny for himself and i wish he had not taken it we had halfanhour i think for tea when i had money enough i used to get halfapint of readymade coffee and a slice of bread and butter when i had none i used to look at a venison shop in fleet street or i have strolled at such a time as far as covent garden market and stared at the pineapples i was fond of wandering about the adelphi because it was a mysterious place with those dark arches i see myself emerging one evening from some of these arches on a little publichouse close to the river with an open space before it where some coalheavers were dancing to look at whom i sat down upon a bench i wonder what they thought of me i was such a child and so little that frequently when i went into the bar of a strange publichouse for a glass of ale or porter to moisten what i had had for dinner they were afraid to give it me i remember one hot evening i went into the bar of a publichouse and said to the landlord ‘what is your bestyour very bestale a glass’ for it was a special occasion i do not know what it may have been my birthday ‘twopencehalfpenny’ says the landlord ‘is the price of the genuine stunning ale’ ‘then’ says i producing the money ‘just draw me a glass of the genuine stunning if you please with a good head to it’ the landlord looked at me in return over the bar from head to foot with a strange smile on his face and instead of drawing the beer looked round the screen and said something to his wife she came out from behind it with her work in her hand and joined him in surveying me here we stand all three before me now the landlord in his shirtsleeves leaning against the bar windowframe his wife looking over the little halfdoor and i in some confusion looking up at them from outside the partition they asked me a good many questions as what my name was how old i was where i lived how i was employed and how i came there to all of which that i might commit nobody i invented i am afraid appropriate answers they served me with the ale though i suspect it was not the genuine stunning and the landlord’s wife opening the little halfdoor of the bar and bending down gave me my money back and gave me a kiss that was half admiring and half compassionate but all womanly and good i am sure i know i do not exaggerate unconsciously and unintentionally the scantiness of my resources or the difficulties of my life i know that if a shilling were given me by mr quinion at any time i spent it in a dinner or a tea i know that i worked from morning until night with common men and boys a shabby child i know that i lounged about the streets insufficiently and unsatisfactorily fed i know that but for the mercy of god i might easily have been for any care that was taken of me a little robber or a little vagabond yet i held some station at murdstone and grinby’s too besides that mr quinion did what a careless man so occupied and dealing with a thing so anomalous could to treat me as one upon a different footing from the rest i never said to man or boy how it was that i came to be there or gave the least indication of being sorry that i was there that i suffered in secret and that i suffered exquisitely no one ever knew but i how much i suffered it is as i have said already utterly beyond my power to tell but i kept my own counsel and i did my work i knew from the first that if i could not do my work as well as any of the rest i could not hold myself above slight and contempt i soon became at least as expeditious and as skilful as either of the other boys though perfectly familiar with them my conduct and manner were different enough from theirs to place a space between us they and the men generally spoke of me as ‘the little gent’ or ‘the young suffolker’ a certain man named gregory who was foreman of the packers and another named tipp who was the carman and wore a red jacket used to address me sometimes as ‘david’ but i think it was mostly when we were very confidential and when i had made some efforts to entertain them over our work with some results of the old readings which were fast perishing out of my remembrance mealy potatoes uprose once and rebelled against my being so distinguished but mick walker settled him in no time my rescue from this kind of existence i considered quite hopeless and abandoned as such altogether i am solemnly convinced that i never for one hour was reconciled to it or was otherwise than miserably unhappy but i bore it and even to peggotty partly for the love of her and partly for shame never in any letter though many passed between us revealed the truth mr micawber’s difficulties were an addition to the distressed state of my mind in my forlorn state i became quite attached to the family and used to walk about busy with mrs micawber’s calculations of ways and means and heavy with the weight of mr micawber’s debts on a saturday night which was my grand treatpartly because it was a great thing to walk home with six or seven shillings in my pocket looking into the shops and thinking what such a sum would buy and partly because i went home earlymrs micawber would make the most heartrending confidences to me also on a sunday morning when i mixed the portion of tea or coffee i had bought overnight in a little shavingpot and sat late at my breakfast it was nothing at all unusual for mr micawber to sob violently at the beginning of one of these saturday night conversations and sing about jack’s delight being his lovely nan towards the end of it i have known him come home to supper with a flood of tears and a declaration that nothing was now left but a jail and go to bed making a calculation of the expense of putting bowwindows to the house ‘in case anything turned up’ which was his favourite expression and mrs micawber was just the same a curious equality of friendship originating i suppose in our respective circumstances sprung up between me and these people notwithstanding the ludicrous disparity in our years but i never allowed myself to be prevailed upon to accept any invitation to eat and drink with them out of their stock knowing that they got on badly with the butcher and baker and had often not too much for themselves until mrs micawber took me into her entire confidence this she did one evening as follows ‘master copperfield’ said mrs micawber ‘i make no stranger of you and therefore do not hesitate to say that mr micawber’s difficulties are coming to a crisis’ it made me very miserable to hear it and i looked at mrs micawber’s red eyes with the utmost sympathy ‘with the exception of the heel of a dutch cheesewhich is not adapted to the wants of a young family’said mrs micawber ‘there is really not a scrap of anything in the larder i was accustomed to speak of the larder when i lived with papa and mama and i use the word almost unconsciously what i mean to express is that there is nothing to eat in the house’ ‘dear me’ i said in great concern i had two or three shillings of my week’s money in my pocketfrom which i presume that it must have been on a wednesday night when we held this conversationand i hastily produced them and with heartfelt emotion begged mrs micawber to accept of them as a loan but that lady kissing me and making me put them back in my pocket replied that she could not think of it ‘no my dear master copperfield’ said she ‘far be it from my thoughts but you have a discretion beyond your years and can render me another kind of service if you will and a service i will thankfully accept of’ i begged mrs micawber to name it ‘i have parted with the plate myself’ said mrs micawber ‘six tea two salt and a pair of sugars i have at different times borrowed money on in secret with my own hands but the twins are a great tie and to me with my recollections of papa and mama these transactions are very painful there are still a few trifles that we could part with mr micawber’s feelings would never allow him to dispose of them and clickett’this was the girl from the workhouse‘being of a vulgar mind would take painful liberties if so much confidence was reposed in her master copperfield if i might ask you’ i understood mrs micawber now and begged her to make use of me to any extent i began to dispose of the more portable articles of property that very evening and went out on a similar expedition almost every morning before i went to murdstone and grinby’s mr micawber had a few books on a little chiffonier which he called the library and those went first i carried them one after another to a bookstall in the city roadone part of which near our house was almost all bookstalls and bird shops thenand sold them for whatever they would bring the keeper of this bookstall who lived in a little house behind it used to get tipsy every night and to be violently scolded by his wife every morning more than once when i went there early i had audience of him in a turnup bedstead with a cut in his forehead or a black eye bearing witness to his excesses overnight i am afraid he was quarrelsome in his drink and he with a shaking hand endeavouring to find the needful shillings in one or other of the pockets of his clothes which lay upon the floor while his wife with a baby in her arms and her shoes down at heel never left off rating him sometimes he had lost his money and then he would ask me to call again but his wife had always got somehad taken his i dare say while he was drunkand secretly completed the bargain on the stairs as we went down together at the pawnbroker’s shop too i began to be very well known the principal gentleman who officiated behind the counter took a good deal of notice of me and often got me i recollect to decline a latin noun or adjective or to conjugate a latin verb in his ear while he transacted my business after all these occasions mrs micawber made a little treat which was generally a supper and there was a peculiar relish in these meals which i well remember at last mr micawber’s difficulties came to a crisis and he was arrested early one morning and carried over to the king’s bench prison in the borough he told me as he went out of the house that the god of day had now gone down upon himand i really thought his heart was broken and mine too but i heard afterwards that he was seen to play a lively game at skittles before noon on the first sunday after he was taken there i was to go and see him and have dinner with him i was to ask my way to such a place and just short of that place i should see such another place and just short of that i should see a yard which i was to cross and keep straight on until i saw a turnkey all this i did and when at last i did see a turnkey poor little fellow that i was and thought how when roderick random was in a debtors’ prison there was a man there with nothing on him but an old rug the turnkey swam before my dimmed eyes and my beating heart mr micawber was waiting for me within the gate and we went up to his room top story but one and cried very much he solemnly conjured me i remember to take warning by his fate and to observe that if a man had twenty pounds ayear for his income and spent nineteen pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence he would be happy but that if he spent twenty pounds one he would be miserable after which he borrowed a shilling of me for porter gave me a written order on mrs micawber for the amount and put away his pockethandkerchief and cheered up we sat before a little fire with two bricks put within the rusted grate one on each side to prevent its burning too many coals until another debtor who shared the room with mr micawber came in from the bakehouse with the loin of mutton which was our jointstock repast then i was sent up to ‘captain hopkins’ in the room overhead with mr micawber’s compliments and i was his young friend and would captain hopkins lend me a knife and fork captain hopkins lent me the knife and fork with his compliments to mr micawber there was a very dirty lady in his little room and two wan girls his daughters with shock heads of hair i thought it was better to borrow captain hopkins’s knife and fork than captain hopkins’s comb the captain himself was in the last extremity of shabbiness with large whiskers and an old old brown greatcoat with no other coat below it i saw his bed rolled up in a corner and what plates and dishes and pots he had on a shelf and i divined god knows how that though the two girls with the shock heads of hair were captain hopkins’s children the dirty lady was not married to captain hopkins my timid station on his threshold was not occupied more than a couple of minutes at most but i came down again with all this in my knowledge as surely as the knife and fork were in my hand there was something gipsylike and agreeable in the dinner after all i took back captain hopkins’s knife and fork early in the afternoon and went home to comfort mrs micawber with an account of my visit she fainted when she saw me return and made a little jug of egghot afterwards to console us while we talked it over i do not know how the household furniture came to be sold for the family benefit or who sold it except that i did not sold it was however and carried away in a van except the bed a few chairs and the kitchen table with these possessions we encamped as it were in the two parlours of the emptied house in windsor terrace mrs micawber the children the orfling and myself and lived in those rooms night and day i have no idea for how long though it seems to me for a long time at last mrs micawber resolved to move into the prison where mr micawber had now secured a room to himself so i took the key of the house to the landlord who was very glad to get it and the beds were sent over to the king’s bench except mine for which a little room was hired outside the walls in the neighbourhood of that institution very much to my satisfaction since the micawbers and i had become too used to one another in our troubles to part the orfling was likewise accommodated with an inexpensive lodging in the same neighbourhood mine was a quiet backgarret with a sloping roof commanding a pleasant prospect of a timberyard and when i took possession of it with the reflection that mr micawber’s troubles had come to a crisis at last i thought it quite a paradise all this time i was working at murdstone and grinby’s in the same common way and with the same common companions and with the same sense of unmerited degradation as at first but i never happily for me no doubt made a single acquaintance or spoke to any of the many boys whom i saw daily in going to the warehouse in coming from it and in prowling about the streets at mealtimes i led the same secretly unhappy life but i led it in the same lonely selfreliant manner the only changes i am conscious of are firstly that i had grown more shabby and secondly that i was now relieved of much of the weight of mr and mrs micawber’s cares for some relatives or friends had engaged to help them at their present pass and they lived more comfortably in the prison than they had lived for a long while out of it i used to breakfast with them now in virtue of some arrangement of which i have forgotten the details i forget too at what hour the gates were opened in the morning admitting of my going in but i know that i was often up at six of the clock and that my favourite loungingplace in the interval was old london bridge where i was will not to sit in one of the stone recesses watching the people going by or to look over the balustrades at the sun shining in the water and lighting up the golden flame on the top of the monument the orfling met me here sometimes to be told some astonishing fictions respecting the wharves and the tower of which i can say no more than that i hope i believed them myself in the evening i used to go back to the prison and walk up and down the parade with mr micawber or play casino with mrs micawber and hear reminiscences of her papa and mama whether mr murdstone knew where i was i am unable to say i never told them at murdstone and grinby’s mr micawber’s affairs although past their crisis were very much involved by reason of a certain ‘deed’ of which i used to hear a great deal and which i suppose now to have been some former composition with his creditors though i was so far from being clear about it then that i am conscious of having confounded it with those demoniacal parchments which are held to have once upon a time obtained to a great extent in germany at last this document appeared to be got out of the way somehow at all events it ceased to be the rockahead it had been and mrs micawber informed me that ‘her family’ had decided that mr micawber should apply for his release under the insolvent debtors act which would set him free she expected in about six weeks ‘and then’ said mr micawber who was present ‘i have no doubt i shall please heaven begin to be beforehand with the world and to live in a perfectly new manner ifin short if anything turns up’ by way of going in for anything that might be on the cards i call to mind that mr micawber about this time composed a petition to the house of commons praying for an alteration in the law of imprisonment for debt i set down this remembrance here because it is an instance to myself of the manner in which i fitted my old books to my altered life and made stories for myself out of the streets and out of men and women and how some main points in the character i shall unconsciously develop i suppose in writing my life were gradually forming all this while there was a club in the prison in which mr micawber as a gentleman was a great authority mr micawber had stated his idea of this petition to the club and the club had strongly approved of the same wherefore mr micawber who was a thoroughly goodnatured man and as active a creature about everything but his own affairs as ever existed and never so happy as when he was busy about something that could never be of any profit to him set to work at the petition invented it engrossed it on an immense sheet of paper spread it out on a table and appointed a time for all the club and all within the walls if they chose to come up to his room and sign it when i heard of this approaching ceremony i was so anxious to see them all come in one after another though i knew the greater part of them already and they me that i got an hour’s leave of absence from murdstone and grinby’s and established myself in a corner for that purpose as many of the principal members of the club as could be got into the small room without filling it supported mr micawber in front of the petition while my old friend captain hopkins who had washed himself to do honour to so solemn an occasion stationed himself close to it to read it to all who were unacquainted with its contents the door was then thrown open and the general population began to come in in a long file several waiting outside while one entered affixed his signature and went out to everybody in succession captain hopkins said ‘have you read it’‘no’‘would you like to hear it read’ if he weakly showed the least disposition to hear it captain hopkins in a loud sonorous voice gave him every word of it the captain would have read it twenty thousand times if twenty thousand people would have heard him one by one i remember a certain luscious roll he gave to such phrases as ‘the people’s representatives in parliament assembled’ ‘your petitioners therefore humbly approach your honourable house’ ‘his gracious majesty’s unfortunate subjects’ as if the words were something real in his mouth and delicious to taste mr micawber meanwhile listening with a little of an author’s vanity and contemplating not severely the spikes on the opposite wall as i walked to and fro daily between southwark and blackfriars and lounged about at mealtimes in obscure streets the stones of which may for anything i know be worn at this moment by my childish feet i wonder how many of these people were wanting in the crowd that used to come filing before me in review again to the echo of captain hopkins’s voice when my thoughts go back now to that slow agony of my youth i wonder how much of the histories i invented for such people hangs like a mist of fancy over wellremembered facts when i tread the old ground i do not wonder that i seem to see and pity going on before me an innocent romantic boy making his imaginative world out of such strange experiences and sordid things
