mr micawber’s gauntlet until the day arrived on which i was to entertain my newlyfound old friends i lived principally on dora and coffee in my lovelorn condition my appetite languished and i was glad of it for i felt as though it would have been an act of perfidy towards dora to have a natural relish for my dinner the quantity of walking exercise i took was not in this respect attended with its usual consequence as the disappointment counteracted the fresh air i have my doubts too founded on the acute experience acquired at this period of my life whether a sound enjoyment of animal food can develop itself freely in any human subject who is always in torment from tight boots i think the extremities require to be at peace before the stomach will conduct itself with vigour on the occasion of this domestic little party i did not repeat my former extensive preparations i merely provided a pair of soles a small leg of mutton and a pigeonpie mrs crupp broke out into rebellion on my first bashful hint in reference to the cooking of the fish and joint and said with a dignified sense of injury ‘no no sir you will not ask me sich a thing for you are better acquainted with me than to suppose me capable of doing what i cannot do with ampial satisfaction to my own feelings’ but in the end a compromise was effected and mrs crupp consented to achieve this feat on condition that i dined from home for a fortnight afterwards and here i may remark that what i underwent from mrs crupp in consequence of the tyranny she established over me was dreadful i never was so much afraid of anyone we made a compromise of everything if i hesitated she was taken with that wonderful disorder which was always lying in ambush in her system ready at the shortest notice to prey upon her vitals if i rang the bell impatiently after halfadozen unavailing modest pulls and she appeared at lastwhich was not by any means to be relied uponshe would appear with a reproachful aspect sink breathless on a chair near the door lay her hand upon her nankeen bosom and become so ill that i was glad at any sacrifice of brandy or anything else to get rid of her if i objected to having my bed made at five of the clock in the afternoonwhich i do still think an uncomfortable arrangementone motion of her hand towards the same nankeen region of wounded sensibility was enough to make me falter an apology in short i would have done anything in an honourable way rather than give mrs crupp offence and she was the terror of my life i bought a secondhand dumbwaiter for this dinnerparty in preference to reengaging the handy young man against whom i had conceived a prejudice in consequence of meeting him in the strand one sunday morning in a waistcoat remarkably like one of mine which had been missing since the former occasion the ‘young gal’ was reengaged but on the stipulation that she should only bring in the dishes and then withdraw to the landingplace beyond the outer door where a habit of sniffing she had contracted would be lost upon the guests and where her retiring on the plates would be a physical impossibility having laid in the materials for a bowl of punch to be compounded by mr micawber having provided a bottle of lavenderwater two waxcandles a paper of mixed pins and a pincushion to assist mrs micawber in her toilette at my dressingtable having also caused the fire in my bedroom to be lighted for mrs micawber’s convenience and having laid the cloth with my own hands i awaited the result with composure at the appointed time my three visitors arrived together mr micawber with more shirtcollar than usual and a new ribbon to his eyeglass mrs micawber with her cap in a whiteybrown paper parcel traddles carrying the parcel and supporting mrs micawber on his arm they were all delighted with my residence when i conducted mrs micawber to my dressingtable and she saw the scale on which it was prepared for her she was in such raptures that she called mr micawber to come in and look ‘my dear copperfield’ said mr micawber ‘this is luxurious this is a way of life which reminds me of the period when i was myself in a state of celibacy and mrs micawber had not yet been solicited to plight her faith at the hymeneal altar’ ‘he means solicited by him mr copperfield’ said mrs micawber archly ‘he cannot answer for others’ ‘my dear’ returned mr micawber with sudden seriousness ‘i have no desire to answer for others i am too well aware that when in the inscrutable decrees of fate you were reserved for me it is possible you may have been reserved for one destined after a protracted struggle at length to fall a victim to pecuniary involvements of a complicated nature i understand your allusion my love i regret it but i can bear it’ ‘micawber’ exclaimed mrs micawber in tears ‘have i deserved this i who never have deserted you who never will desert you micawber’ ‘my love’ said mr micawber much affected ‘you will forgive and our old and tried friend copperfield will i am sure forgive the momentary laceration of a wounded spirit made sensitive by a recent collision with the minion of powerin other words with a ribald turncock attached to the waterworksand will pity not condemn its excesses’ mr micawber then embraced mrs micawber and pressed my hand leaving me to infer from this broken allusion that his domestic supply of water had been cut off that afternoon in consequence of default in the payment of the company’s rates to divert his thoughts from this melancholy subject i informed mr micawber that i relied upon him for a bowl of punch and led him to the lemons his recent despondency not to say despair was gone in a moment i never saw a man so thoroughly enjoy himself amid the fragrance of lemonpeel and sugar the odour of burning rum and the steam of boiling water as mr micawber did that afternoon it was wonderful to see his face shining at us out of a thin cloud of these delicate fumes as he stirred and mixed and tasted and looked as if he were making instead of punch a fortune for his family down to the latest posterity as to mrs micawber i do not know whether it was the effect of the cap or the lavenderwater or the pins or the fire or the waxcandles but she came out of my room comparatively speaking lovely and the lark was never gayer than that excellent woman i supposei never ventured to inquire but i supposethat mrs crupp after frying the soles was taken ill because we broke down at that point the leg of mutton came up very red within and very pale without besides having a foreign substance of a gritty nature sprinkled over it as if if had had a fall into the ashes of that remarkable kitchen fireplace but we were not in condition to judge of this fact from the appearance of the gravy forasmuch as the ‘young gal’ had dropped it all upon the stairswhere it remained by the by in a long train until it was worn out the pigeonpie was not bad but it was a delusive pie the crust being like a disappointing head phrenologically speaking full of lumps and bumps with nothing particular underneath in short the banquet was such a failure that i should have been quite unhappyabout the failure i mean for i was always unhappy about doraif i had not been relieved by the great good humour of my company and by a bright suggestion from mr micawber ‘my dear friend copperfield’ said mr micawber ‘accidents will occur in the bestregulated families and in families not regulated by that pervading influence which sanctifies while it enhances theai would say in short by the influence of woman in the lofty character of wife they may be expected with confidence and must be borne with philosophy if you will allow me to take the liberty of remarking that there are few comestibles better in their way than a devil and that i believe with a little division of labour we could accomplish a good one if the young person in attendance could produce a gridiron i would put it to you that this little misfortune may be easily repaired’ there was a gridiron in the pantry on which my morning rasher of bacon was cooked we had it in in a twinkling and immediately applied ourselves to carrying mr micawber’s idea into effect the division of labour to which he had referred was thistraddles cut the mutton into slices mr micawber who could do anything of this sort to perfection covered them with pepper mustard salt and cayenne i put them on the gridiron turned them with a fork and took them off under mr micawber’s direction and mrs micawber heated and continually stirred some mushroom ketchup in a little saucepan when we had slices enough done to begin upon we fellto with our sleeves still tucked up at the wrist more slices sputtering and blazing on the fire and our attention divided between the mutton on our plates and the mutton then preparing what with the novelty of this cookery the excellence of it the bustle of it the frequent starting up to look after it the frequent sitting down to dispose of it as the crisp slices came off the gridiron hot and hot the being so busy so flushed with the fire so amused and in the midst of such a tempting noise and savour we reduced the leg of mutton to the bone my own appetite came back miraculously i am ashamed to record it but i really believe i forgot dora for a little while i am satisfied that mr and mrs micawber could not have enjoyed the feast more if they had sold a bed to provide it traddles laughed as heartily almost the whole time as he ate and worked indeed we all did all at once and i dare say there was never a greater success we were at the height of our enjoyment and were all busily engaged in our several departments endeavouring to bring the last batch of slices to a state of perfection that should crown the feast when i was aware of a strange presence in the room and my eyes encountered those of the staid littimer standing hat in hand before me ‘what is the matter’ i involuntarily asked ‘i beg your pardon sir i was directed to come in is my master not here sir’ ‘no’ ‘have you not seen him sir’ ‘no do not you come from him’ ‘not immediately so sir’ ‘did he tell you you would find him here’ ‘not exactly so sir but i should think he might be here tomorrow as he has not been here today’ ‘is he coming up from oxford’ ‘i beg sir’ he returned respectfully ‘that you will be seated and allow me to do this’ with which he took the fork from my unresisting hand and bent over the gridiron as if his whole attention were concentrated on it we should not have been much discomposed i dare say by the appearance of steerforth himself but we became in a moment the meekest of the meek before his respectable servingman mr micawber humming a tune to show that he was quite at ease subsided into his chair with the handle of a hastily concealed fork sticking out of the bosom of his coat as if he had stabbed himself mrs micawber put on her brown gloves and assumed a genteel languor traddles ran his greasy hands through his hair and stood it bolt upright and stared in confusion on the tablecloth as for me i was a mere infant at the head of my own table and hardly ventured to glance at the respectable phenomenon who had come from heaven knows where to put my establishment to rights meanwhile he took the mutton off the gridiron and gravely handed it round we all took some but our appreciation of it was gone and we merely made a show of eating it as we severally pushed away our plates he noiselessly removed them and set on the cheese he took that off too when it was done with cleared the table piled everything on the dumbwaiter gave us our wineglasses and of his own accord wheeled the dumbwaiter into the pantry all this was done in a perfect manner and he never raised his eyes from what he was about yet his very elbows when he had his back towards me seemed to teem with the expression of his fixed opinion that i was extremely young ‘can i do anything more sir’ i thanked him and said no but would he take no dinner himself ‘none i am obliged to you sir’ ‘is mr steerforth coming from oxford’ ‘i beg your pardon sir’ ‘is mr steerforth coming from oxford’ ‘i should imagine that he might be here tomorrow sir i rather thought he might have been here today sir the mistake is mine no doubt sir’ ‘if you should see him first’ said i ‘if you will excuse me sir i do not think i shall see him first’ ‘in case you do’ said i ‘pray say that i am sorry he was not here today as an old schoolfellow of his was here’ ‘indeed sir’ and he divided a bow between me and traddles with a glance at the latter he was moving softly to the door when in a forlorn hope of saying something naturallywhich i never could to this mani said ‘oh littimer’ ‘sir’ ‘did you remain long at yarmouth that time’ ‘not particularly so sir’ ‘you saw the boat completed’ ‘yes sir i remained behind on purpose to see the boat completed’ ‘i know’ he raised his eyes to mine respectfully ‘mr steerforth has not seen it yet i suppose’ ‘i really cannot say sir i thinkbut i really cannot say sir i wish you good night sir’ he comprehended everybody present in the respectful bow with which he followed these words and disappeared my visitors seemed to breathe more freely when he was gone but my own relief was very great for besides the constraint arising from that extraordinary sense of being at a disadvantage which i always had in this man’s presence my conscience had embarrassed me with whispers that i had mistrusted his master and i could not repress a vague uneasy dread that he might find it out how was it having so little in reality to conceal that i always did feel as if this man were finding me out mr micawber roused me from this reflection which was blended with a certain remorseful apprehension of seeing steerforth himself by bestowing many encomiums on the absent littimer as a most respectable fellow and a thoroughly admirable servant mr micawber i may remark had taken his full share of the general bow and had received it with infinite condescension ‘but punch my dear copperfield’ said mr micawber tasting it ‘like time and tide waits for no man ah it is at the present moment in high flavour my love will you give me your opinion’ mrs micawber pronounced it excellent ‘then i will drink’ said mr micawber ‘if my friend copperfield will permit me to take that social liberty to the days when my friend copperfield and myself were younger and fought our way in the world side by side i may say of myself and copperfield in words we have sung together before now that we twa hae run about the braes and pu’d the gowans’ fine in a figurative point of viewon several occasions i am not exactly aware’ said mr micawber with the old roll in his voice and the old indescribable air of saying something genteel ‘what gowans may be but i have no doubt that copperfield and myself would frequently have taken a pull at them if it had been feasible’ mr micawber at the then present moment took a pull at his punch so we all did traddles evidently lost in wondering at what distant time mr micawber and i could have been comrades in the battle of the world ‘ahem’ said mr micawber clearing his throat and warming with the punch and with the fire ‘my dear another glass’ mrs micawber said it must be very little but we could not allow that so it was a glassful ‘as we are quite confidential here mr copperfield’ said mrs micawber sipping her punch ‘mr traddles being a part of our domesticity i should much like to have your opinion on mr micawber’s prospects for corn’ said mrs micawber argumentatively ‘as i have repeatedly said to mr micawber may be gentlemanly but it is not remunerative commission to the extent of two and ninepence in a fortnight cannot however limited our ideas be considered remunerative’ we were all agreed upon that ‘then’ said mrs micawber who prided herself on taking a clear view of things and keeping mr micawber straight by her woman’s wisdom when he might otherwise go a little crooked ‘then i ask myself this question if corn is not to be relied upon what is are coals to be relied upon not at all we have turned our attention to that experiment on the suggestion of my family and we find it fallacious’ mr micawber leaning back in his chair with his hands in his pockets eyed us aside and nodded his head as much as to say that the case was very clearly put ‘the articles of corn and coals’ said mrs micawber still more argumentatively ‘being equally out of the question mr copperfield i naturally look round the world and say “what is there in which a person of mr micawber’s talent is likely to succeed” and i exclude the doing anything on commission because commission is not a certainty what is best suited to a person of mr micawber’s peculiar temperament is i am convinced a certainty’ traddles and i both expressed by a feeling murmur that this great discovery was no doubt true of mr micawber and that it did him much credit ‘i will not conceal from you my dear mr copperfield’ said mrs micawber ‘that i have long felt the brewing business to be particularly adapted to mr micawber look at barclay and perkins look at truman hanbury and buxton it is on that extensive footing that mr micawber i know from my own knowledge of him is calculated to shine and the profits i am told are enormous but if mr micawber cannot get into those firmswhich decline to answer his letters when he offers his services even in an inferior capacitywhat is the use of dwelling upon that idea none i may have a conviction that mr micawber’s manners’ ‘hem really my dear’ interposed mr micawber ‘my love be silent’ said mrs micawber laying her brown glove on his hand ‘i may have a conviction mr copperfield that mr micawber’s manners peculiarly qualify him for the banking business i may argue within myself that if i had a deposit at a bankinghouse the manners of mr micawber as representing that bankinghouse would inspire confidence and must extend the connexion but if the various bankinghouses refuse to avail themselves of mr micawber’s abilities or receive the offer of them with contumely what is the use of dwelling upon that idea none as to originating a bankingbusiness i may know that there are members of my family who if they chose to place their money in mr micawber’s hands might found an establishment of that description but if they do not choose to place their money in mr micawber’s handswhich they do notwhat is the use of that again i contend that we are no farther advanced than we were before’ i shook my head and said ‘not a bit’ traddles also shook his head and said ‘not a bit’ ‘what do i deduce from this’ mrs micawber went on to say still with the same air of putting a case lucidly ‘what is the conclusion my dear mr copperfield to which i am irresistibly brought am i wrong in saying it is clear that we must live’ i answered ‘not at all’ and traddles answered ‘not at all’ and i found myself afterwards sagely adding alone that a person must either live or die ‘just so’ returned mrs micawber ‘it is precisely that and the fact is my dear mr copperfield that we can not live without something widely different from existing circumstances shortly turning up now i am convinced myself and this i have pointed out to mr micawber several times of late that things cannot be expected to turn up of themselves we must in a measure assist to turn them up i may be wrong but i have formed that opinion’ both traddles and i applauded it highly ‘very well’ said mrs micawber ‘then what do i recommend here is mr micawber with a variety of qualificationswith great talent’ ‘really my love’ said mr micawber ‘pray my dear allow me to conclude here is mr micawber with a variety of qualifications with great talenti should say with genius but that may be the partiality of a wife’ traddles and i both murmured ‘no’ ‘and here is mr micawber without any suitable position or employment where does that responsibility rest clearly on society then i would make a fact so disgraceful known and boldly challenge society to set it right it appears to me my dear mr copperfield’ said mrs micawber forcibly ‘that what mr micawber has to do is to throw down the gauntlet to society and say in effect “show me who will take that up let the party immediately step forward”’ i ventured to ask mrs micawber how this was to be done ‘by advertising’ said mrs micawber‘in all the papers it appears to me that what mr micawber has to do in justice to himself in justice to his family and i will even go so far as to say in justice to society by which he has been hitherto overlooked is to advertise in all the papers to describe himself plainly as soandso with such and such qualifications and to put it thus “now employ me on remunerative terms and address postpaid to w m post office camden town”’ ‘this idea of mrs micawber’s my dear copperfield’ said mr micawber making his shirtcollar meet in front of his chin and glancing at me sideways ‘is in fact the leap to which i alluded when i last had the pleasure of seeing you’ ‘advertising is rather expensive’ i remarked dubiously ‘exactly so’ said mrs micawber preserving the same logical air ‘quite true my dear mr copperfield i have made the identical observation to mr micawber it is for that reason especially that i think mr micawber ought as i have already said in justice to himself in justice to his family and in justice to society to raise a certain sum of moneyon a bill’ mr micawber leaning back in his chair trifled with his eyeglass and cast his eyes up at the ceiling but i thought him observant of traddles too who was looking at the fire ‘if no member of my family’ said mrs micawber ‘is possessed of sufficient natural feeling to negotiate that billi believe there is a better businessterm to express what i mean’ mr micawber with his eyes still cast up at the ceiling suggested ‘discount’ ‘to discount that bill’ said mrs micawber ‘then my opinion is that mr micawber should go into the city should take that bill into the money market and should dispose of it for what he can get if the individuals in the money market oblige mr micawber to sustain a great sacrifice that is between themselves and their consciences i view it steadily as an investment i recommend mr micawber my dear mr copperfield to do the same to regard it as an investment which is sure of return and to make up his mind to any sacrifice’ i felt but i am sure i do not know why that this was selfdenying and devoted in mrs micawber and i uttered a murmur to that effect traddles who took his tone from me did likewise still looking at the fire ‘i will not’ said mrs micawber finishing her punch and gathering her scarf about her shoulders preparatory to her withdrawal to my bedroom ‘i will not protract these remarks on the subject of mr micawber’s pecuniary affairs at your fireside my dear mr copperfield and in the presence of mr traddles who though not so old a friend is quite one of ourselves i could not refrain from making you acquainted with the course i advise mr micawber to take i feel that the time is arrived when mr micawber should exert himself andi will addassert himself and it appears to me that these are the means i am aware that i am merely a female and that a masculine judgement is usually considered more competent to the discussion of such questions still i must not forget that when i lived at home with my papa and mama my papa was in the habit of saying “emma’s form is fragile but her grasp of a subject is inferior to none” that my papa was too partial i well know but that he was an observer of character in some degree my duty and my reason equally forbid me to doubt’ with these words and resisting our entreaties that she would grace the remaining circulation of the punch with her presence mrs micawber retired to my bedroom and really i felt that she was a noble womanthe sort of woman who might have been a roman matron and done all manner of heroic things in times of public trouble in the fervour of this impression i congratulated mr micawber on the treasure he possessed so did traddles mr micawber extended his hand to each of us in succession and then covered his face with his pockethandkerchief which i think had more snuff upon it than he was aware of he then returned to the punch in the highest state of exhilaration he was full of eloquence he gave us to understand that in our children we lived again and that under the pressure of pecuniary difficulties any accession to their number was doubly welcome he said that mrs micawber had latterly had her doubts on this point but that he had dispelled them and reassured her as to her family they were totally unworthy of her and their sentiments were utterly indifferent to him and they mighti quote his own expressiongo to the devil mr micawber then delivered a warm eulogy on traddles he said traddles’s was a character to the steady virtues of which he mr micawber could lay no claim but which he thanked heaven he could admire he feelingly alluded to the young lady unknown whom traddles had honoured with his affection and who had reciprocated that affection by honouring and blessing traddles with her affection mr micawber pledged her so did i traddles thanked us both by saying with a simplicity and honesty i had sense enough to be quite charmed with ‘i am very much obliged to you indeed and i do assure you she is the dearest girl’ mr micawber took an early opportunity after that of hinting with the utmost delicacy and ceremony at the state of my affections nothing but the serious assurance of his friend copperfield to the contrary he observed could deprive him of the impression that his friend copperfield loved and was beloved after feeling very hot and uncomfortable for some time and after a good deal of blushing stammering and denying i said having my glass in my hand ‘well i would give them d’ which so excited and gratified mr micawber that he ran with a glass of punch into my bedroom in order that mrs micawber might drink d who drank it with enthusiasm crying from within in a shrill voice ‘hear hear my dear mr copperfield i am delighted hear’ and tapping at the wall by way of applause our conversation afterwards took a more worldly turn mr micawber telling us that he found camden town inconvenient and that the first thing he contemplated doing when the advertisement should have been the because of something satisfactory turning up was to move he mentioned a terrace at the western end of oxford street fronting hyde park on which he had always had his eye but which he did not expect to attain immediately as it would require a large establishment there would probably be an interval he explained in which he should content himself with the upper part of a house over some respectable place of businesssay in piccadillywhich would be a cheerful situation for mrs micawber and where by throwing out a bowwindow or carrying up the roof another story or making some little alteration of that sort they might live comfortably and reputably for a few years whatever was reserved for him he expressly said or wherever his abode might be we might rely on thisthere would always be a room for traddles and a knife and fork for me we acknowledged his kindness and he begged us to forgive his having launched into these practical and businesslike details and to excuse it as natural in one who was making entirely new arrangements in life mrs micawber tapping at the wall again to know if tea were ready broke up this particular phase of our friendly conversation she made tea for us in a most agreeable manner and whenever i went near her in handing about the teacups and breadandbutter asked me in a whisper whether d was fair or dark or whether she was short or tall or something of that kind which i think i liked after tea we discussed a variety of topics before the fire and mrs micawber was good enough to sing us in a small thin flat voice which i remembered to have considered when i first knew her the very tablebeer of acoustics the favourite ballads of ‘the dashing white sergeant’ and ‘little tafflin’ for both of these songs mrs micawber had been famous when she lived at home with her papa and mama mr micawber told us that when he heard her sing the first one on the first occasion of his seeing her beneath the parental roof she had attracted his attention in an extraordinary degree but that when it came to little tafflin he had resolved to win that woman or perish in the attempt it was between ten and eleven of the clock when mrs micawber rose to replace her cap in the whiteybrown paper parcel and to put on her bonnet mr micawber took the opportunity of traddles putting on his greatcoat to slip a letter into my hand with a whispered request that i would read it at my leisure i also took the opportunity of my holding a candle over the banisters to light them down when mr micawber was going first leading mrs micawber and traddles was following with the cap to detain traddles for a moment on the top of the stairs ‘traddles’ said i ‘mr micawber do not mean any harm poor fellow but if i were you i would not lend him anything’ ‘my dear copperfield’ returned traddles smiling ‘i have not got anything to lend’ ‘you have got a name you know’ said i ‘oh you call that something to lend’ returned traddles with a thoughtful look ‘certainly’ ‘oh’ said traddles ‘yes to be sure i am very much obliged to you copperfield buti am afraid i have lent him that already’ ‘for the bill that is to be a certain investment’ i inquired ‘no’ said traddles ‘not for that one this is the first i have heard of that one i have been thinking that he will most likely propose that one on the way home mine’s another’ ‘i hope there will be nothing wrong about it’ said i ‘i hope not’ said traddles ‘i should think not though because he told me only the other day that it was provided for that was mr micawber’s expression “provided for”’ mr micawber looking up at this juncture to where we were standing i had only time to repeat my caution traddles thanked me and descended but i was much afraid when i observed the goodnatured manner in which he went down with the cap in his hand and gave mrs micawber his arm that he would be carried into the money market neck and heels i returned to my fireside and was musing half gravely and half laughing on the character of mr micawber and the old relations between us when i heard a quick step ascending the stairs at first i thought it was traddles coming back for something mrs micawber had left behind but as the step approached i knew it and felt my heart beat high and the blood rush to my face for it was steerforth’s i was never unmindful of agnes and she never left that sanctuary in my thoughtsif i may call it sowhere i had placed her from the first but when he entered and stood before me with his hand out the darkness that had fallen on him changed to light and i felt confounded and ashamed of having doubted one i loved so heartily i loved her none the less i thought of her as the same benignant gentle angel in my life i reproached myself not her with having done him an injury and i would have made him any atonement if i had known what to make and how to make it ‘why daisy old boy dumbfoundered’ laughed steerforth shaking my hand heartily and throwing it gaily away ‘have i detected you in another feast you sybarite these doctors’ commons fellows are the gayest men in town i believe and beat us sober oxford people all to nothing’ his bright glance went merrily round the room as he took the seat on the sofa opposite to me which mrs micawber had recently vacated and stirred the fire into a blaze ‘i was so surprised at first’ said i giving him welcome with all the cordiality i felt ‘that i had hardly breath to greet you with steerforth’ ‘well the sight of me is good for sore eyes as the scotch say’ replied steerforth ‘and so is the sight of you daisy in full bloom how are you my bacchanal’ ‘i am very well’ said i ‘and not at all bacchanalian tonight though i confess to another party of three’ ‘all of whom i met in the street talking loud in your praise’ returned steerforth ‘who is our friend in the tights’ i gave him the best idea i could in a few words of mr micawber he laughed heartily at my feeble portrait of that gentleman and said he was a man to know and he must know him ‘but who do you suppose our other friend is’ said i in my turn ‘heaven knows’ said steerforth ‘not a bore i hope i thought he looked a little like one’ ‘traddles’ i replied triumphantly ‘who is he’ asked steerforth in his careless way ‘do not you remember traddles traddles in our room at salem house’ ‘oh that fellow’ said steerforth beating a lump of coal on the top of the fire with the poker ‘is he as soft as ever and where the deuce did you pick him up’ i extolled traddles in reply as highly as i could for i felt that steerforth rather slighted him steerforth dismissing the subject with a light nod and a smile and the remark that he would be glad to see the old fellow too for he had always been an odd fish inquired if i could give him anything to eat during most of this short dialogue when he had not been speaking in a wild vivacious manner he had sat idly beating on the lump of coal with the poker i observed that he did the same thing while i was getting out the remains of the pigeonpie and so forth ‘why daisy here is a supper for a king’ he exclaimed starting out of his silence with a burst and taking his seat at the table ‘i shall do it justice for i have come from yarmouth’ ‘i thought you came from oxford’ i returned ‘not i’ said steerforth ‘i have been seafaringbetter employed’ ‘littimer was here today to inquire for you’ i remarked ‘and i understood him that you were at oxford though now i think of it he certainly did not say so’ ‘littimer is a greater fool than i thought him to have been inquiring for me at all’ said steerforth jovially pouring out a glass of wine and drinking to me ‘as to understanding him you are a cleverer fellow than most of us daisy if you can do that’ ‘that is true indeed’ said i moving my chair to the table ‘so you have been at yarmouth steerforth’ interested to know all about it ‘have you been there long’ ‘no’ he returned ‘an escapade of a week or so’ ‘and how are they all of course little emily is not married yet’ ‘not yet going to be i believein so many weeks or months or something or other i have not seen much of ‘them by the by’ he laid down his knife and fork which he had been using with great diligence and began feeling in his pockets ‘i have a letter for you’ ‘from whom’ ‘why from your old nurse’ he returned taking some papers out of his breast pocket “‘j steerforth esquire debtor to the willing mind” that is not it patience and we will find it presently old what ishisname’s in a bad way and it is about that i believe’ ‘barkis do you mean’ ‘yes’ still feeling in his pockets and looking over their contents ‘it is all over with poor barkis i am afraid i saw a little apothecary theresurgeon or whatever he iswho brought your worship into the world he was mighty learned about the case to me but the upshot of his opinion was that the carrier was making his last journey rather fastput your hand into the breast pocket of my greatcoat on the chair yonder and i think you will find the letter is it there’ ‘here it is’ said i ‘that is right’ it was from peggotty something less legible than usual and brief it informed me of her husband’s hopeless state and hinted at his being ‘a little nearer’ than heretofore and consequently more difficult to manage for his own comfort it said nothing of her weariness and watching and praised him highly it was written with a plain unaffected homely piety that i knew to be genuine and ended with ‘my duty to my ever darling’meaning myself while i deciphered it steerforth continued to eat and drink ‘it is a bad job’ he said when i had done ‘but the sun sets every day and people die every minute and we must not be scared by the common lot if we failed to hold our own because that equal foot at all men’s doors was heard knocking somewhere every object in this world would slip from us no ride on roughshod if need be smoothshod if that will do but ride on ride on over all obstacles and win the race’ ‘and win what race’ said i ‘the race that one has started in’ said he ‘ride on’ i noticed i remember as he paused looking at me with his handsome head a little thrown back and his glass raised in his hand that though the freshness of the seawind was on his face and it was ruddy there were traces in it made since i last saw it as if he had applied himself to some habitual strain of the fervent energy which when roused was so passionately roused within him i had it in my thoughts to remonstrate with him upon his desperate way of pursuing any fancy that he tooksuch as this buffeting of rough seas and braving of hard weather for examplewhen my mind glanced off to the immediate subject of our conversation again and pursued that instead ‘i tell you what steerforth’ said i ‘if your high spirits will listen to me’ ‘they are potent spirits and will do whatever you like’ he answered moving from the table to the fireside again ‘then i tell you what steerforth i think i will go down and see my old nurse it is not that i can do her any good or render her any real service but she is so attached to me that my visit will have as much effect on her as if i could do both she will take it so kindly that it will be a comfort and support to her it is no great effort to make i am sure for such a friend as she has been to me would not you go a day’s journey if you were in my place’ his face was thoughtful and he sat considering a little before he answered in a low voice ‘well go you can do no harm’ ‘you have just come back’ said i ‘and it would be in vain to ask you to go with me’ ‘quite’ he returned ‘i am for highgate tonight i have not seen my mother this long time and it lies upon my conscience for it is something to be loved as she loves her prodigal sonbah nonsenseyou mean to go tomorrow i suppose’ he said holding me out at arm’s length with a hand on each of my shoulders ‘yes i think so’ ‘well then do not go till next day i wanted you to come and stay a few days with us here i am on purpose to bid you and you fly off to yarmouth’ ‘you are a nice fellow to talk of flying off steerforth who are always running wild on some unknown expedition or other’ he looked at me for a moment without speaking and then rejoined still holding me as before and giving me a shake ‘come say the next day and pass as much of tomorrow as you can with us who knows when we may meet again else come say the next day i want you to stand between rosa dartle and me and keep us asunder’ ‘would you love each other too much without me’ ‘yes or hate’ laughed steerforth ‘no matter which come say the next day’ i said the next day and he put on his greatcoat and lighted his cigar and set off to walk home finding him in this intention i put on my own greatcoat but did not light my own cigar having had enough of that for one while and walked with him as far as the open road a dull road then at night he was in great spirits all the way and when we parted and i looked after him going so gallantly and airily homeward i thought of his saying ‘ride on over all obstacles and win the race’ and wished for the first time that he had some worthy race to run i was undressing in my own room when mr micawber’s letter tumbled on the floor thus reminded of it i broke the seal and read as follows it was dated an hour and a half before dinner i am not sure whether i have mentioned that when mr micawber was at any particularly desperate crisis he used a sort of legal phraseology which he seemed to think equivalent to winding up his affairs ‘sirfor i dare not say my dear copperfield ‘it is expedient that i should inform you that the undersigned is crushed some flickering efforts to spare you the premature knowledge of his calamitous position you may observe in him this day but hope has sunk beneath the horizon and the undersigned is crushed ‘the present communication is penned within the personal range i cannot call it the society of an individual in a state closely bordering on intoxication employed by a broker that individual is in legal possession of the premises under a distress for rent his inventory includes not only the chattels and effects of every description belonging to the undersigned as yearly tenant of this habitation but also those appertaining to mr thomas traddles lodger a member of the honourable society of the inner temple ‘if any drop of gloom were wanting in the overflowing cup which is now “commended” in the language of an immortal writer to the lips of the undersigned it would be found in the fact that a friendly acceptance granted to the undersigned by the beforementioned mr thomas traddles for the sum of 23l 4s nine one2d is over due and is not provided for also in the fact that the living responsibilities clinging to the undersigned will in the course of nature be increased by the sum of one more helpless victim whose miserable appearance may be looked forin round numbersat the expiration of a period not exceeding six lunar months from the present date ‘after premising thus much it would be a work of supererogation to add that dust and ashes are for ever scattered ‘on ‘the ‘head ‘of ‘wilkins micawber’ poor traddles i knew enough of mr micawber by this time to foresee that he might be expected to recover the blow but my night’s rest was sorely distressed by thoughts of traddles and of the curate’s daughter who was one of ten down in devonshire and who was such a dear girl and who would wait for traddles ominous praise until she was sixty or any age that could be mentioned
