return i landed in london on a wintry autumn evening it was dark and raining and i saw more fog and mud in a minute than i had seen in a year i walked from the custom house to the monument before i found a coach and although the very housefronts looking on the swollen gutters were like old friends to me i could not but admit that they were very dingy friends i have often remarkedi suppose everybody hasthat one’s going away from a familiar place would seem to be the signal for change in it as i looked out of the coach window and observed that an old house on fishstreet hill which had stood untouched by painter carpenter or bricklayer for a century had been pulled down in my absence and that a neighbouring street of timehonoured insalubrity and inconvenience was being drained and widened i half expected to find st paul’s cathedral looking older for some changes in the fortunes of my friends i was prepared my aunt had long been reestablished at dover and traddles had begun to get into some little practice at the bar in the very first term after my departure he had chambers in gray’s inn now and had told me in his last letters that he was not without hopes of being soon united to the dearest girl in the world they expected me home before christmas but had no idea of my returning so soon i had purposely misled them that i might have the pleasure of taking them by surprise and yet i was perverse enough to feel a chill and disappointment in receiving no welcome and rattling alone and silent through the misty streets the wellknown shops however with their cheerful lights did something for me and when i alighted at the door of the gray’s inn coffeehouse i had recovered my spirits it recalled at first that sodifferent time when i had put up at the golden cross and reminded me of the changes that had come to pass since then but that was natural ‘do you know where mr traddles lives in the inn’ i asked the waiter as i warmed myself by the coffeeroom fire ‘holborn court sir number two’ ‘mr traddles has a rising reputation among the lawyers i believe’ said i ‘well sir’ returned the waiter ‘probably he has sir but i am not aware of it myself’ this waiter who was middleaged and spare looked for help to a waiter of more authoritya stout potential old man with a double chin in black breeches and stockings who came out of a place like a churchwarden’s pew at the end of the coffeeroom where he kept company with a cashbox a directory a lawlist and other books and papers ‘mr traddles’ said the spare waiter ‘number two in the court’ the potential waiter waved him away and turned gravely to me ‘i was inquiring’ said i ‘whether mr traddles at number two in the court has not a rising reputation among the lawyers’ ‘never heard his name’ said the waiter in a rich husky voice i felt quite apologetic for traddles ‘he is a young man sure’ said the portentous waiter fixing his eyes severely on me ‘how long has he been in the inn’ ‘not above three years’ said i the waiter who i supposed had lived in his churchwarden’s pew for forty years could not pursue such an insignificant subject he asked me what i would have for dinner i felt i was in england again and really was quite cast down on traddles’s account there seemed to be no hope for him i meekly ordered a bit of fish and a steak and stood before the fire musing on his obscurity as i followed the chief waiter with my eyes i could not help thinking that the garden in which he had gradually blown to be the flower he was was an arduous place to rise in it had such a prescriptive stiffnecked longestablished solemn elderly air i glanced about the room which had had its sanded floor sanded no doubt in exactly the same manner when the chief waiter was a boyif he ever was a boy which appeared improbable and at the shining tables where i saw myself reflected in unruffled depths of old mahogany and at the lamps without a flaw in their trimming or cleaning and at the comfortable green curtains with their pure brass rods snugly enclosing the boxes and at the two large coal fires brightly burning and at the rows of decanters burly as if with the consciousness of pipes of expensive old port wine below and both england and the law appeared to me to be very difficult indeed to be taken by storm i went up to my bedroom to change my wet clothes and the vast extent of that old wainscoted apartment which was over the archway leading to the inn i remember and the sedate immensity of the fourpost bedstead and the indomitable gravity of the chests of drawers all seemed to unite in sternly frowning on the fortunes of traddles or on any such daring youth i came down again to my dinner and even the slow comfort of the meal and the orderly silence of the placewhich was bare of guests the long vacation not yet being overwere eloquent on the audacity of traddles and his small hopes of a livelihood for twenty years to come i had seen nothing like this since i went away and it quite dashed my hopes for my friend the chief waiter had had enough of me he came near me no more but devoted himself to an old gentleman in long gaiters to meet whom a pint of special port seemed to come out of the cellar of its own accord for he gave no order the second waiter informed me in a whisper that this old gentleman was a retired conveyancer living in the square and worth a mint of money which it was expected he would leave to his laundress’s daughter likewise that it was rumoured that he had a service of plate in a bureau all tarnished with lying by though more than one spoon and a fork had never yet been beheld in his chambers by mortal vision by this time i quite gave traddles up for lost and settled in my own mind that there was no hope for him being very anxious to see the dear old fellow nevertheless i dispatched my dinner in a manner not at all calculated to raise me in the opinion of the chief waiter and hurried out by the back way number two in the court was soon reached and an inscription on the doorpost informing me that mr traddles occupied a set of chambers on the top storey i ascended the staircase a crazy old staircase i found it to be feebly lighted on each landing by a clubheaded little oil wick dying away in a little dungeon of dirty glass in the course of my stumbling upstairs i fancied i heard a pleasant sound of laughter and not the laughter of an attorney or barrister or attorney’s clerk or barrister’s clerk but of two or three merry girls happening however as i stopped to listen to put my foot in a hole where the honourable society of gray’s inn had left a plank deficient i fell down with some noise and when i recovered my footing all was silent groping my way more carefully for the rest of the journey my heart beat high when i found the outer door which had mr traddles painted on it open i knocked a considerable scuffling within ensued but nothing else i therefore knocked again a small sharplooking lad halffootboy and halfclerk who was very much out of breath but who looked at me as if he defied me to prove it legally presented himself ‘is mr traddles within’ i said ‘yes sir but he is engaged’ ‘i want to see him’ after a moment’s survey of me the sharplooking lad decided to let me in and opening the door wider for that purpose admitted me first into a little closet of a hall and next into a little sittingroom where i came into the presence of my old friend also out of breath seated at a table and bending over papers ‘good god’ cried traddles looking up ‘it is copperfield’ and rushed into my arms where i held him tight ‘all well my dear traddles’ ‘all well my dear dear copperfield and nothing but good news’ we cried with pleasure both of us ‘my dear fellow’ said traddles rumpling his hair in his excitement which was a most unnecessary operation ‘my dearest copperfield my longlost and most welcome friend how glad i am to see you how brown you are how glad i am upon my life and honour i never was so rejoiced my beloved copperfield never’ i was equally at a loss to express my emotions i was quite unable to speak at first ‘my dear fellow’ said traddles ‘and grown so famous my glorious copperfield good gracious me when did you come where have you come from what have you been doing’ never pausing for an answer to anything he said traddles who had clapped me into an easychair by the fire all this time impetuously stirred the fire with one hand and pulled at my neckkerchief with the other under some wild delusion that it was a greatcoat without putting down the poker he now hugged me again and i hugged him and both laughing and both wiping our eyes we both sat down and shook hands across the hearth ‘to think’ said traddles ‘that you should have been so nearly coming home as you must have been my dear old boy and not at the ceremony’ ‘what ceremony my dear traddles’ ‘good gracious me’ cried traddles opening his eyes in his old way ‘did not you get my last letter’ ‘certainly not if it referred to any ceremony’ ‘why my dear copperfield’ said traddles sticking his hair upright with both hands and then putting his hands on my knees ‘i am married’ ‘married’ i cried joyfully ‘lord bless me yes’ said traddles‘by the reverend horaceto sophydown in devonshire why my dear boy she is behind the window curtain look here’ to my amazement the dearest girl in the world came at that same instant laughing and blushing from her place of concealment and a more cheerful amiable honest happy brightlooking bride i believe as i could not help saying on the spot the world never saw i kissed her as an old acquaintance should and wished them joy with all my might of heart ‘dear me’ said traddles ‘what a delightful reunion this is you are so extremely brown my dear copperfield god bless my soul how happy i am’ ‘and so am i’ said i ‘and i am sure i am’ said the blushing and laughing sophy ‘we are all as happy as possible’ said traddles ‘even the girls are happy dear me i declare i forgot them’ ‘forgot’ said i ‘the girls’ said traddles ‘sophy’s sisters they are staying with us they have come to have a peep at london the fact is whenwas it you that tumbled upstairs copperfield’ ‘it was’ said i laughing ‘well then when you tumbled upstairs’ said traddles ‘i was romping with the girls in point of fact we were playing at puss in the corner but as that would not do in westminster hall and as it would not look quite professional if they were seen by a client they decamped and they are nowlistening i have no doubt’ said traddles glancing at the door of another room ‘i am sorry’ said i laughing afresh ‘to have occasioned such a dispersion’ ‘upon my word’ rejoined traddles greatly delighted ‘if you had seen them running away and running back again after you had knocked to pick up the combs they had dropped out of their hair and going on in the maddest manner you would not have said so my love will you fetch the girls’ sophy tripped away and we heard her received in the adjoining room with a peal of laughter ‘really musical is not it my dear copperfield’ said traddles ‘it is very agreeable to hear it quite lights up these old rooms to an unfortunate bachelor of a fellow who has lived alone all his life you know it is positively delicious it is charming poor things they have had a great loss in sophywho i do assure you copperfield is and ever was the dearest girland it gratifies me beyond expression to find them in such good spirits the society of girls is a very delightful thing copperfield it is not professional but it is very delightful’ observing that he slightly faltered and comprehending that in the goodness of his heart he was fearful of giving me some pain by what he had said i expressed my concurrence with a heartiness that evidently relieved and pleased him greatly ‘but then’ said traddles ‘our domestic arrangements are to say the truth quite unprofessional altogether my dear copperfield even sophy’s being here is unprofessional and we have no other place of abode we have put to sea in a cockboat but we are quite prepared to rough it and sophy’s an extraordinary manager you will be surprised how those girls are stowed away i am sure i hardly know how it is done’ ‘are many of the young ladies with you’ i inquired ‘the eldest the beauty is here’ said traddles in a low confidential voice ‘caroline and sarah’s herethe one i mentioned to you as having something the matter with her spine you know immensely better and the two youngest that sophy educated are with us and louisa’s here’ ‘indeed’ cried i ‘yes’ said traddles ‘now the whole seti mean the chambersis only three rooms but sophy arranges for the girls in the most wonderful way and they sleep as comfortably as possible three in that room’ said traddles pointing ‘two in that’ i could not help glancing round in search of the accommodation remaining for mr and mrs traddles traddles understood me ‘well’ said traddles ‘we are prepared to rough it as i said just now and we did improvise a bed last week upon the floor here but there is a little room in the roofa very nice room when you are up therewhich sophy papered herself to surprise me and that is our room at present it is a capital little gipsy sort of place there is quite a view from it’ ‘and you are happily married at last my dear traddles’ said i ‘how rejoiced i am’ ‘thank you my dear copperfield’ said traddles as we shook hands once more ‘yes i am as happy as it is possible to be there is your old friend you see’ said traddles nodding triumphantly at the flowerpot and stand ‘and there is the table with the marble top all the other furniture is plain and serviceable you perceive and as to plate lord bless you we have not so much as a teaspoon’ ‘all to be earned’ said i cheerfully ‘exactly so’ replied traddles ‘all to be earned of course we have something in the shape of teaspoons because we stir our tea but they are britannia metal’ ‘the silver will be the brighter when it comes’ said i ‘the very thing we say’ cried traddles ‘you see my dear copperfield’ falling again into the low confidential tone ‘after i had delivered my argument in doe dem jipes versus wigziell which did me great service with the profession i went down into devonshire and had some serious conversation in private with the reverend horace i dwelt upon the fact that sophywho i do assure you copperfield is the dearest girl’ ‘i am certain she is’ said i ‘she is indeed’ rejoined traddles ‘but i am afraid i am wandering from the subject did i mention the reverend horace’ ‘you said that you dwelt upon the fact’ ‘true upon the fact that sophy and i had been engaged for a long period and that sophy with the permission of her parents was more than content to take mein short’ said traddles with his old frank smile ‘on our present britanniametal footing very well i then proposed to the reverend horacewho is a most excellent clergyman copperfield and ought to be a bishop or at least ought to have enough to live upon without pinching himselfthat if i could turn the corner say of two hundred and fifty pounds in one year and could see my way pretty clearly to that or something better next year and could plainly furnish a little place like this besides then and in that case sophy and i should be united i took the liberty of representing that we had been patient for a good many years and that the circumstance of sophy’s being extraordinarily useful at home ought not to operate with her affectionate parents against her establishment in lifedo not you see’ ‘certainly it ought not’ said i ‘i am glad you think so copperfield’ rejoined traddles ‘because without any imputation on the reverend horace i do think parents and brothers and so forth are sometimes rather selfish in such cases well i also pointed out that my most earnest desire was to be useful to the family and that if i got on in the world and anything should happen to himi refer to the reverend horace’ ‘i understand’ said i ‘or to mrs crewlerit would be the utmost gratification of my wishes to be a parent to the girls he replied in a most admirable manner exceedingly flattering to my feelings and undertook to obtain the consent of mrs crewler to this arrangement they had a dreadful time of it with her it mounted from her legs into her chest and then into her head’ ‘what mounted’ i asked ‘her grief’ replied traddles with a serious look ‘her feelings generally as i mentioned on a former occasion she is a very superior woman but has lost the use of her limbs whatever occurs to harass her usually settles in her legs but on this occasion it mounted to the chest and then to the head and in short pervaded the whole system in a most alarming manner however they brought her through it by unremitting and affectionate attention and we were married yesterday six weeks you have no idea what a monster i felt copperfield when i saw the whole family crying and fainting away in every direction mrs crewler could not see me before we leftcould not forgive me then for depriving her of her childbut she is a good creature and has done so since i had a delightful letter from her only this morning’ ‘and in short my dear friend’ said i ‘you feel as blest as you deserve to feel’ ‘oh that is your partiality’ laughed traddles ‘but indeed i am in a most enviable state i work hard and read law insatiably i get up at five every morning and do not mind it at all i hide the girls in the daytime and make merry with them in the evening and i assure you i am quite sorry that they are going home on tuesday which is the day before the first day of michaelmas term but here’ said traddles breaking off in his confidence and speaking aloud ‘are the girls mr copperfield miss crewlermiss sarahmiss louisamargaret and lucy’ they were a perfect nest of roses they looked so wholesome and fresh they were all pretty and miss caroline was very handsome but there was a loving cheerful fireside quality in sophy’s bright looks which was better than that and which assured me that my friend had chosen well we all sat round the fire while the sharp boy who i now divined had lost his breath in putting the papers out cleared them away again and produced the teathings after that he retired for the night shutting the outer door upon us with a bang mrs traddles with perfect pleasure and composure beaming from her household eyes having made the tea then quietly made the toast as she sat in a corner by the fire she had seen agnes she told me while she was toasting ‘tom’ had taken her down into kent for a wedding trip and there she had seen my aunt too and both my aunt and agnes were well and they had all talked of nothing but me ‘tom’ had never had me out of his thoughts she really believed all the time i had been away ‘tom’ was the authority for everything ‘tom’ was evidently the idol of her life never to be shaken on his pedestal by any commotion always to be believed in and done homage to with the whole faith of her heart come what might the deference which both she and traddles showed towards the beauty pleased me very much i do not know that i thought it very reasonable but i thought it very delightful and essentially a part of their character if traddles ever for an instant missed the teaspoons that were still to be won i have no doubt it was when he handed the beauty her tea if his sweettempered wife could have got up any selfassertion against anyone i am satisfied it could only have been because she was the beauty’s sister a few slight indications of a rather petted and capricious manner which i observed in the beauty were manifestly considered by traddles and his wife as her birthright and natural endowment if she had been born a queen bee and they labouring bees they could not have been more satisfied of that but their selfforgetfulness charmed me their pride in these girls and their submission of themselves to all their whims was the pleasantest little testimony to their own worth i could have desired to see if traddles were addressed as ‘a darling’ once in the course of that evening and besought to bring something here or carry something there or take something up or put something down or find something or fetch something he was so addressed by one or other of his sistersinlaw at least twelve times in an hour neither could they do anything without sophy somebody is hair fell down and nobody but sophy could put it up somebody forgot how a particular tune went and nobody but sophy could hum that tune right somebody wanted to recall the name of a place in devonshire and only sophy knew it something was wanted to be written home and sophy alone could be trusted to write before breakfast in the morning somebody broke down in a piece of knitting and no one but sophy was able to put the defaulter in the right direction they were entire mistresses of the place and sophy and traddles waited on them how many children sophy could have taken care of in her time i cannot imagine but she seemed to be famous for knowing every sort of song that ever was addressed to a child in the english tongue and she sang dozens to order with the clearest little voice in the world one after another every sister issuing directions for a different tune and the beauty generally striking in last so that i was quite fascinated the best of all was that in the midst of their exactions all the sisters had a great tenderness and respect both for sophy and traddles i am sure when i took my leave and traddles was coming out to walk with me to the coffeehouse i thought i had never seen an obstinate head of hair or any other head of hair rolling about in such a shower of kisses altogether it was a scene i could not help dwelling on with pleasure for a long time after i got back and had wished traddles good night if i had beheld a thousand roses blowing in a top set of chambers in that withered gray’s inn they could not have brightened it half so much the idea of those devonshire girls among the dry lawstationers and the attorneys’ offices and of the tea and toast and children’s songs in that grim atmosphere of pounce and parchment redtape dusty wafers inkjars brief and draft paper law reports writs declarations and bills of costs seemed almost as pleasantly fanciful as if i had dreamed that the sultan’s famous family had been admitted on the roll of attorneys and had brought the talking bird the singing tree and the golden water into gray’s inn hall somehow i found that i had taken leave of traddles for the night and come back to the coffeehouse with a great change in my despondency about him i began to think he would get on in spite of all the many orders of chief waiters in england drawing a chair before one of the coffeeroom fires to think about him at my leisure i gradually fell from the consideration of his happiness to tracing prospects in the livecoals and to thinking as they broke and changed of the principal vicissitudes and separations that had marked my life i had not seen a coal fire since i had left england three years ago though many a wood fire had i watched as it crumbled into hoary ashes and mingled with the feathery heap upon the hearth which not inaptly figured to me in my despondency my own dead hopes i could think of the past now gravely but not bitterly and could contemplate the future in a brave spirit home in its best sense was for me no more she in whom i might have inspired a dearer love i had taught to be my sister she would marry and would have new claimants on her tenderness and in doing it would never know the love for her that had grown up in my heart it was right that i should pay the forfeit of my headlong passion what i reaped i had sown i was thinking and had i truly disciplined my heart to this and could i resolutely bear it and calmly hold the place in her home which she had calmly held in minewhen i found my eyes resting on a countenance that might have arisen out of the fire in its association with my early remembrances little mr chillip the doctor to whose good offices i was indebted in the very first this history sat reading a newspaper in the shadow of an opposite corner he was tolerably stricken in years by this time but being a mild meek calm little man had worn so easily that i thought he looked at that moment just as he might have looked when he sat in our parlour waiting for me to be born mr chillip had left blunderstone six or seven years ago and i had never seen him since he sat placidly perusing the newspaper with his little head on one side and a glass of warm sherry negus at his elbow he was so extremely conciliatory in his manner that he seemed to apologize to the very newspaper for taking the liberty of reading it i walked up to where he was sitting and said ‘how do you do mr chillip’ he was greatly fluttered by this unexpected address from a stranger and replied in his slow way ‘i thank you sir you are very good thank you sir i hope you are well’ ‘you do not remember me’ said i ‘well sir’ returned mr chillip smiling very meekly and shaking his head as he surveyed me ‘i have a kind of an impression that something in your countenance is familiar to me sir but i could not lay my hand upon your name really’ ‘and yet you knew it long before i knew it myself’ i returned ‘did i indeed sir’ said mr chillip ‘is it possible that i had the honour sir of officiating when’ ‘yes’ said i ‘dear me’ cried mr chillip ‘but no doubt you are a good deal changed since then sir’ ‘probably’ said i ‘well sir’ observed mr chillip ‘i hope you will excuse me if i am compelled to ask the favour of your name’ on my telling him my name he was really moved he quite shook hands with mewhich was a violent proceeding for him his usual course being to slide a tepid little fishslice an inch or two in advance of his hip and evince the greatest discomposure when anybody grappled with it even now he put his hand in his coatpocket as soon as he could disengage it and seemed relieved when he had got it safe back ‘dear me sir’ said mr chillip surveying me with his head on one side ‘and it is mr copperfield is it well sir i think i should have known you if i had taken the liberty of looking more closely at you there is a strong resemblance between you and your poor father sir’ ‘i never had the happiness of seeing my father’ i observed ‘very true sir’ said mr chillip in a soothing tone ‘and very much to be deplored it was on all accounts we are not ignorant sir’ said mr chillip slowly shaking his little head again ‘down in our part of the country of your fame there must be great excitement here sir’ said mr chillip tapping himself on the forehead with his forefinger ‘you must find it a trying occupation sir’ ‘what is your part of the country now’ i asked seating myself near him ‘i am established within a few miles of bury st edmund’s sir’ said mr chillip ‘mrs chillip coming into a little property in that neighbourhood under her father’s will i bought a practice down there in which you will be glad to hear i am doing well my daughter is growing quite a tall lass now sir’ said mr chillip giving his little head another little shake ‘her mother let down two tucks in her frocks only last week such is time you see sir’ as the little man put his now empty glass to his lips when he made this reflection i proposed to him to have it refilled and i would keep him company with another ‘well sir’ he returned in his slow way ‘it is more than i am accustomed to but i cannot deny myself the pleasure of your conversation it seems but yesterday that i had the honour of attending you in the measles you came through them charmingly sir’ i acknowledged this compliment and ordered the negus which was soon produced ‘quite an uncommon dissipation’ said mr chillip stirring it ‘but i cannot resist so extraordinary an occasion you have no family sir’ i shook my head ‘i was aware that you sustained a bereavement sir some time ago’ said mr chillip ‘i heard it from your fatherinlaw’s sister very decided character there sir’ ‘why yes’ said i ‘decided enough where did you see her mr chillip’ ‘are you not aware sir’ returned mr chillip with his placidest smile ‘that your fatherinlaw is again a neighbour of mine’ ‘no’ said i ‘he is indeed sir’ said mr chillip ‘married a young lady of that part with a very good little property poor thingand this action of the brain now sir do not you find it fatigue you’ said mr chillip looking at me like an admiring robin i waived that question and returned to the murdstones ‘i was aware of his being married again do you attend the family’ i asked ‘not regularly i have been called in’ he replied ‘strong phrenological developments of the organ of firmness in mr murdstone and his sister sir’ i replied with such an expressive look that mr chillip was emboldened by that and the negus together to give his head several short shakes and thoughtfully exclaim ‘ah dear me we remember old times mr copperfield’ ‘and the brother and sister are pursuing their old course are they’ said i ‘well sir’ replied mr chillip ‘a medical man being so much in families ought to have neither eyes nor ears for anything but his profession still i must say they are very severe sir both as to this life and the next’ ‘the next will be regulated without much reference to them i dare say’ i returned ‘what are they doing as to this’ mr chillip shook his head stirred his negus and sipped it ‘she was a charming woman sir’ he observed in a plaintive manner ‘the present mrs murdstone’ ‘a charming woman indeed sir’ said mr chillip ‘as amiable i am sure as it was possible to be mrs chillip’s opinion is that her spirit has been entirely broken since her marriage and that she is all but melancholy mad and the ladies’ observed mr chillip timorously ‘are great observers sir’ ‘i suppose she was to be subdued and broken to their detestable mould heaven help her’ said i ‘and she has been’ ‘well sir there were violent quarrels at first i assure you’ said mr chillip ‘but she is quite a shadow now would it be considered forward if i was to say to you sir in confidence that since the sister came to help the brother and sister between them have nearly reduced her to a state of imbecility’ i told him i could easily believe it ‘i have no hesitation in saying’ said mr chillip fortifying himself with another sip of negus ‘between you and me sir that her mother died of itor that tyranny gloom and worry have made mrs murdstone nearly imbecile she was a lively young woman sir before marriage and their gloom and austerity destroyed her they go about with her now more like her keepers than her husband and sisterinlaw that was mrs chillip’s remark to me only last week and i assure you sir the ladies are great observers mrs chillip herself is a great observer’ ‘does he gloomily profess to be i am ashamed to use the word in such association religious still’ i inquired ‘you anticipate sir’ said mr chillip his eyelids getting quite red with the unwonted stimulus in which he was indulging ‘one of mrs chillip’s most impressive remarks mrs chillip’ he proceeded in the calmest and slowest manner ‘quite electrified me by pointing out that mr murdstone sets up an image of himself and calls it the divine nature you might have knocked me down on the flat of my back sir with the feather of a pen i assure you when mrs chillip said so the ladies are great observers sir’ ‘intuitively’ said i to his extreme delight ‘i am very happy to receive such support in my opinion sir’ he rejoined ‘it is not often that i venture to give a nonmedical opinion i assure you mr murdstone delivers public addresses sometimes and it is saidin short sir it is said by mrs chillipthat the darker tyrant he has lately been the more ferocious is his doctrine’ ‘i believe mrs chillip to be perfectly right’ said i ‘mrs chillip does go so far as to say’ pursued the meekest of little men much encouraged ‘that what such people miscall their religion is a vent for their bad humours and arrogance and do you know i must say sir’ he continued mildly laying his head on one side ‘that i do not find authority for mr and miss murdstone in the new testament’ ‘i never found it either’ said i ‘in the meantime sir’ said mr chillip ‘they are much disliked and as they are very free in consigning everybody who dislikes them to perdition we really have a good deal of perdition going on in our neighbourhood however as mrs chillip says sir they undergo a continual punishment for they are turned inward to feed upon their own hearts and their own hearts are very bad feeding now sir about that brain of yours if you will excuse my returning to it do not you expose it to a good deal of excitement sir’ i found it not difficult in the excitement of mr chillip’s own brain under his potations of negus to divert his attention from this topic to his own affairs on which for the next halfhour he was quite loquacious giving me to understand among other pieces of information that he was then at the gray’s inn coffeehouse to lay his professional evidence before a commission of lunacy touching the state of mind of a patient who had become deranged from excessive drinking ‘and i assure you sir’ he said ‘i am extremely nervous on such occasions i could not support being what is called bullied sir it would quite unman me do you know it was some time before i recovered the conduct of that alarming lady on the night of your birth mr copperfield’ i told him that i was going down to my aunt the dragon of that night early in the morning and that she was one of the most tenderhearted and excellent of women as he would know full well if he knew her better the mere notion of the possibility of his ever seeing her again appeared to terrify him he replied with a small pale smile ‘is she so indeed sir really’ and almost immediately called for a candle and went to bed as if he were not quite safe anywhere else he did not actually stagger under the negus but i should think his placid little pulse must have made two or three more beats in a minute than it had done since the great night of my aunt’s disappointment when she struck at him with her bonnet thoroughly tired i went to bed too at midnight passed the next day on the dover coach burst safe and sound into my aunt’s old parlour while she was at tea she wore spectacles now and was received by her and mr dick and dear old peggotty who acted as housekeeper with open arms and tears of joy my aunt was mightily amused when we began to talk composedly by my account of my meeting with mr chillip and of his holding her in such dread remembrance and both she and peggotty had a great deal to say about my poor mother’s second husband and ‘that murdering woman of a sister’on whom i think no pain or penalty would have induced my aunt to bestow any christian or proper name or any other designation
