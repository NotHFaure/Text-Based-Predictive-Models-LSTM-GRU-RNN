i observe the first objects that assume a distinct presence before me as i look far back into the blank of my infancy are my mother with her pretty hair and youthful shape and peggotty with no shape at all and eyes so dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face and cheeks and arms so hard and red that i wondered the birds did not peck her in preference to apples i believe i can remember these two at a little distance apart dwarfed to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor and i going unsteadily from the one to the other i have an impression on my mind which i cannot distinguish from actual remembrance of the touch of peggotty’s forefinger as she used to hold it out to me and of its being roughened by needlework like a pocket nutmeggrater this may be fancy though i think the memory of most of us can go farther back into such times than many of us suppose just as i believe the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite wonderful for its closeness and accuracy indeed i think that most grown men who are remarkable in this respect may with greater propriety be said not to have lost the faculty than to have acquired it the rather as i generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness and gentleness and capacity of being pleased which are also an inheritance they have preserved from their childhood i might have a misgiving that i am ‘meandering’ in stopping to say this but that it brings me to remark that i build these conclusions in part upon my own experience of myself and if it should appear from anything i may set down in this narrative that i was a child of close observation or that as a man i have a strong memory of my childhood i undoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics looking back as i was saying into the blank of my infancy the first objects i can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of things are my mother and peggotty what else do i remember let me see there comes out of the cloud our housenot new to me but quite familiar in its earliest remembrance on the groundfloor is peggotty’s kitchen opening into a back yard with a pigeonhouse on a pole in the centre without any pigeons in it a great dogkennel in a corner without any dog and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me walking about in a menacing and ferocious manner there is one cock who gets upon a post to crow and seems to take particular notice of me as i look at him through the kitchen window who makes me shiver he is so fierce of the geese outside the sidegate who come waddling after me with their long necks stretched out when i go that way i dream at night as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions here is a long passagewhat an enormous perspective i make of itleading from peggotty’s kitchen to the front door a dark storeroom opens out of it and that is a place to be run past at night for i do not know what may be among those tubs and jars and old teachests when there is nobody in there with a dimlyburning light letting a mouldy air come out of the door in which there is the smell of soap pickles pepper candles and coffee all at one whiff then there are the two parlours the parlour in which we sit of an evening my mother and i and peggottyfor peggotty is quite our companion when her work is done and we are aloneand the best parlour where we sit on a sunday grandly but not so comfortably there is something of a doleful air about that room to me for peggotty has told mei do not know when but apparently ages agoabout my father’s funeral and the company having their black cloaks put on one sunday night my mother reads to peggotty and me in there how lazarus was raised up from the dead and i am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take me out of bed and show me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom window with the dead all lying in their graves at rest below the solemn moon there is nothing half so green that i know anywhere as the grass of that churchyard nothing half so shady as its trees nothing half so quiet as its tombstones the sheep are feeding there when i kneel up early in the morning in my little bed in a closet within my mother’s room to look out at it and i see the red light shining on the sundial and think within myself ‘is the sundial glad i wonder that it can tell the time again’ here is our pew in the church what a highbacked pew with a window near it out of which our house can be seen and is seen many times during the morning’s service by peggotty who likes to make herself as sure as she can that it is not being robbed or is not in flames but though peggotty’s eye wanders she is much offended if mine does and frowns to me as i stand upon the seat that i am to look at the clergyman but i cannot always look at himi know him without that white thing on and i am afraid of his wondering why i stare so and perhaps stopping the service to inquireand what am i to do it is a dreadful thing to gape but i must do something i look at my mother but she pretends not to see me i look at a boy in the aisle and he makes faces at me i look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through the porch and there i see a stray sheepi do not mean a sinner but muttonhalf making up his mind to come into the church i feel that if i looked at him any longer i might be tempted to say something out loud and what would become of me then i look up at the monumental tablets on the wall and try to think of mr bodgers late of this parish and what the feelings of mrs bodgers must have been when affliction sore long time mr bodgers bore and physicians were in vain i wonder whether they called in mr chillip and he was in vain and if so how he likes to be reminded of it once a week i look from mr chillip in his sunday neckcloth to the pulpit and think what a good place it would be to play in and what a castle it would make with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it and having the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head in time my eyes gradually shut up and from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a drowsy song in the heat i hear nothing until i fall off the seat with a crash and am taken out more dead than alive by peggotty and now i see the outside of our house with the latticed bedroomwindows standing open to let in the sweetsmelling air and the ragged old rooks’nests still dangling in the elmtrees at the bottom of the front garden now i am in the garden at the back beyond the yard where the empty pigeonhouse and dogkennel area very preserve of butterflies as i remember it with a high fence and a gate and padlock where the fruit clusters on the trees riper and richer than fruit has ever been since in any other garden and where my mother gathers some in a basket while i stand by bolting furtive gooseberries and trying to look unmoved a great wind rises and the summer is gone in a moment we are playing in the winter twilight dancing about the parlour when my mother is out of breath and rests herself in an elbowchair i watch her winding her bright curls round her fingers and straitening her waist and nobody knows better than i do that she likes to look so well and is proud of being so pretty that is among my very earliest impressions that and a sense that we were both a little afraid of peggotty and submitted ourselves in most things to her direction were among the first opinionsif they may be so calledthat i ever derived from what i saw peggotty and i were sitting one night by the parlour fire alone i had been reading to peggotty about crocodiles i must have read very perspicuously or the poor soul must have been deeply interested for i remember she had a cloudy impression after i had done that they were a sort of vegetable i was tired of reading and dead sleepy but having leave as a high treat to sit up until my mother came home from spending the evening at a neighbour’s i would rather have died upon my post of course than have gone to bed i had reached that stage of sleepiness when peggotty seemed to swell and grow immensely large i propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers and looked perseveringly at her as she sat at work at the little bit of waxcandle she kept for her threadhow old it looked being so wrinkled in all directionsat the little house with a thatched roof where the yardmeasure lived at her workbox with a sliding lid with a view of st paul’s cathedral with a pink dome painted on the top at the brass thimble on her finger at herself whom i thought lovely i felt so sleepy that i knew if i lost sight of anything for a moment i was gone ‘peggotty’ says i suddenly ‘were you ever married’ ‘lord master davy’ replied peggotty ‘what is put marriage in your head’ she answered with such a start that it quite awoke me and then she stopped in her work and looked at me with her needle drawn out to its thread’s length ‘but were you ever married peggotty’ says i ‘you are a very handsome woman an’t you’ i thought her in a different style from my mother certainly but of another school of beauty i considered her a perfect example there was a red velvet footstool in the best parlour on which my mother had painted a nosegay the groundwork of that stool and peggotty’s complexion appeared to me to be one and the same thing the stool was smooth and peggotty was rough but that made no difference ‘me handsome davy’ said peggotty ‘lawk no my dear but what put marriage in your head’ ‘i do not knowyou must not marry more than one person at a time may you peggotty’ ‘certainly not’ says peggotty with the promptest decision ‘but if you marry a person and the person dies why then you may marry another person may not you peggotty’ ‘you may’ says peggotty ‘if you choose my dear that is a matter of opinion’ ‘but what is your opinion peggotty’ said i i asked her and looked curiously at her because she looked so curiously at me ‘my opinion is’ said peggotty taking her eyes from me after a little indecision and going on with her work ‘that i never was married myself master davy and that i do not expect to be that is all i know about the subject’ ‘you an’t cross i suppose peggotty are you’ said i after sitting quiet for a minute i really thought she was she had been so short with me but i was quite mistaken for she laid aside her work which was a stocking of her own and opening her arms wide took my curly head within them and gave it a good squeeze i know it was a good squeeze because being very plump whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed some of the buttons on the back of her gown flew off and i recollect two bursting to the opposite side of the parlour while she was hugging me ‘now let me hear some more about the crorkindills’ said peggotty who was not quite right in the name yet ‘for i an’t heard half enough’ i could not quite understand why peggotty looked so queer or why she was so ready to go back to the crocodiles however we returned to those monsters with fresh wakefulness on my part and we left their eggs in the sand for the sun to hatch and we ran away from them and baffled them by constantly turning which they were unable to do quickly on account of their unwieldy make and we went into the water after them as natives and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats and in short we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet i did at least but i had my doubts of peggotty who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into various parts of her face and arms all the time we had exhausted the crocodiles and begun with the alligators when the gardenbell rang we went out to the door and there was my mother looking unusually pretty i thought and with her a gentleman with beautiful black hair and whiskers who had walked home with us from church last sunday as my mother stooped down on the threshold to take me in her arms and kiss me the gentleman said i was a more highly privileged little fellow than a monarchor something like that for my later understanding comes i am sensible to my aid here ‘what does that mean’ i asked him over her shoulder he patted me on the head but somehow i did not like him or his deep voice and i was jealous that his hand should touch my mother’s in touching mewhich it did i put it away as well as i could ‘oh davy’ remonstrated my mother ‘dear boy’ said the gentleman ‘i cannot wonder at his devotion’ i never saw such a beautiful colour on my mother’s face before she gently chid me for being rude and keeping me close to her shawl turned to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her home she put out her hand to him as she spoke and as he met it with his own she glanced i thought at me ‘let us say “good night” my fine boy’ said the gentleman when he had bent his headi saw himover my mother’s little glove ‘good night’ said i ‘come let us be the best friends in the world’ said the gentleman laughing ‘shake hands’ my right hand was in my mother’s left so i gave him the other ‘why that is the wrong hand davy’ laughed the gentleman my mother drew my right hand forward but i was resolved for my former reason not to give it him and i did not i gave him the other and he shook it heartily and said i was a brave fellow and went away at this minute i see him turn round in the garden and give us a last look with his illomened black eyes before the door was shut peggotty who had not said a word or moved a finger secured the fastenings instantly and we all went into the parlour my mother contrary to her usual habit instead of coming to the elbowchair by the fire remained at the other end of the room and sat singing to herself ‘hope you have had a pleasant evening madam’ said peggotty standing as stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room with a candlestick in her hand ‘much obliged to you peggotty’ returned my mother in a cheerful voice ‘i have had a very pleasant evening’ ‘a stranger or so makes an agreeable change’ suggested peggotty ‘a very agreeable change indeed’ returned my mother peggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the room and my mother resuming her singing i fell asleep though i was not so sound asleep but that i could hear voices without hearing what they said when i half awoke from this uncomfortable doze i found peggotty and my mother both in tears and both talking ‘not such a one as this mr copperfield would not have liked’ said peggotty ‘that i say and that i swear’ ‘good heavens’ cried my mother ‘you will drive me mad was ever any poor girl so illused by her servants as i am why do i do myself the injustice of calling myself a girl have i never been married peggotty’ ‘god knows you have madam’ returned peggotty ‘then how can you dare’ said my mother‘you know i do not mean how can you dare peggotty but how can you have the heartto make me so uncomfortable and say such bitter things to me when you are well aware that i have not out of this place a single friend to turn to’ ‘the more’s the reason’ returned peggotty ‘for saying that it will not do no that it will not do no no price could make it do no’i thought peggotty would have thrown the candlestick away she was so emphatic with it ‘how can you be so aggravating’ said my mother shedding more tears than before ‘as to talk in such an unjust manner how can you go on as if it was all settled and arranged peggotty when i tell you over and over again you cruel thing that beyond the commonest civilities nothing has passed you talk of admiration what am i to do if people are so silly as to indulge the sentiment is it my fault what am i to do i ask you would you wish me to shave my head and black my face or disfigure myself with a burn or a scald or something of that sort i dare say you would peggotty i dare say you would quite enjoy it’ peggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart i thought ‘and my dear boy’ cried my mother coming to the elbowchair in which i was and caressing me ‘my own little davy is it to be hinted to me that i am wanting in affection for my precious treasure the dearest little fellow that ever was’ ‘nobody never went and hinted no such a thing’ said peggotty ‘you did peggotty’ returned my mother ‘you know you did what else was it possible to infer from what you said you unkind creature when you know as well as i do that on his account only last quarter i would not buy myself a new parasol though that old green one is frayed the whole way up and the fringe is perfectly mangy you know it is peggotty you cannot deny it’ then turning affectionately to me with her cheek against mine ‘am i a naughty mama to you davy am i a nasty cruel selfish bad mama say i am my child say “yes” dear boy and peggotty will love you and peggotty’s love is a great deal better than mine davy i do not love you at all do i’ at this we all fell acrying together i think i was the loudest of the party but i am sure we were all sincere about it i was quite heartbroken myself and am afraid that in the first transports of wounded tenderness i called peggotty a ‘beast’ that honest creature was in deep affliction i remember and must have become quite buttonless on the occasion for a little volley of those explosives went off when after having made it up with my mother she kneeled down by the elbowchair and made it up with me we went to bed greatly dejected my sobs kept waking me for a long time and when one very strong sob quite hoisted me up in bed i found my mother sitting on the coverlet and leaning over me i fell asleep in her arms after that and slept soundly whether it was the following sunday when i saw the gentleman again or whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared i cannot recall i do not profess to be clear about dates but there he was in church and he walked home with us afterwards he came in too to look at a famous geranium we had in the parlourwindow it did not appear to me that he took much notice of it but before he went he asked my mother to give him a bit of the blossom she begged him to choose it for himself but he refused to do thati could not understand whyso she plucked it for him and gave it into his hand he said he would never never part with it any more and i thought he must be quite a fool not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two peggotty began to be less with us of an evening than she had always been my mother deferred to her very muchmore than usual it occurred to meand we were all three excellent friends still we were different from what we used to be and were not so comfortable among ourselves sometimes i fancied that peggotty perhaps objected to my mother’s wearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers or to her going so often to visit at that neighbour’s but i could not to my satisfaction make out how it was gradually i became used to seeing the gentleman with the black whiskers i liked him no better than at first and had the same uneasy jealousy of him but if i had any reason for it beyond a child’s instinctive dislike and a general idea that peggotty and i could make much of my mother without any help it certainly was not the reason that i might have found if i had been older no such thing came into my mind or near it i could observe in little pieces as it were but as to making a net of a number of these pieces and catching anybody in it that was as yet beyond me one autumn morning i was with my mother in the front garden when mr murdstonei knew him by that name nowcame by on horseback he reined up his horse to salute my mother and said he was going to lowestoft to see some friends who were there with a yacht and merrily proposed to take me on the saddle before him if i would like the ride the air was so clear and pleasant and the horse seemed to like the idea of the ride so much himself as he stood snorting and pawing at the gardengate that i had a great desire to go so i was sent upstairs to peggotty to be made spruce and in the meantime mr murdstone dismounted and with his horse’s bridle drawn over his arm walked slowly up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence while my mother walked slowly up and down on the inner to keep him company i recollect peggotty and i peeping out at them from my little window i recollect how closely they seemed to be examining the sweetbriar between them as they strolled along and how from being in a perfectly angelic temper peggotty turned cross in a moment and brushed my hair the wrong way excessively hard mr murdstone and i were soon off and trotting along on the green turf by the side of the road he held me quite easily with one arm and i do not think i was restless usually but i could not make up my mind to sit in front of him without turning my head sometimes and looking up in his face he had that kind of shallow black eyei want a better word to express an eye that has no depth in it to be looked intowhich when it is abstracted seems from some peculiarity of light to be disfigured for a moment at a time by a cast several times when i glanced at him i observed that appearance with a sort of awe and wondered what he was thinking about so closely his hair and whiskers were blacker and thicker looked at so near than even i had given them credit for being a squareness about the lower part of his face and the dotted indication of the strong black beard he shaved close every day reminded me of the waxwork that had travelled into our neighbourhood some halfayear before this his regular eyebrows and the rich white and black and brown of his complexionconfound his complexion and his memorymade me think him in spite of my misgivings a very handsome man i have no doubt that my poor dear mother thought him so too we went to an hotel by the sea where two gentlemen were smoking cigars in a room by themselves each of them was lying on at least four chairs and had a large rough jacket on in a corner was a heap of coats and boatcloaks and a flag all bundled up together they both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner when we came in and said ‘halloa murdstone we thought you were dead’ ‘not yet’ said mr murdstone ‘and who is this shaver’ said one of the gentlemen taking hold of me ‘that is davy’ returned mr murdstone ‘davy who’ said the gentleman ‘jones’ ‘copperfield’ said mr murdstone ‘what bewitching mrs copperfield’s encumbrance’ cried the gentleman ‘the pretty little widow’ ‘quinion’ said mr murdstone ‘take care if you please somebody is sharp’ ‘who is’ asked the gentleman laughing i looked up quickly being curious to know ‘only brooks of sheffield’ said mr murdstone i was quite relieved to find that it was only brooks of sheffield for at first i really thought it was i there seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of mr brooks of sheffield for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he was mentioned and mr murdstone was a good deal amused also after some laughing the gentleman whom he had called quinion said ‘and what is the opinion of brooks of sheffield in reference to the projected business’ ‘why i do not know that brooks understands much about it at present’ replied mr murdstone ‘but he is not generally favourable i believe’ there was more laughter at this and mr quinion said he would ring the bell for some sherry in which to drink to brooks this he did and when the wine came he made me have a little with a biscuit and before i drank it stand up and say ‘confusion to brooks of sheffield’ the toast was received with great applause and such hearty laughter that it made me laugh too at which they laughed the more in short we quite enjoyed ourselves we walked about on the cliff after that and sat on the grass and looked at things through a telescopei could make out nothing myself when it was put to my eye but i pretended i couldand then we came back to the hotel to an early dinner all the time we were out the two gentlemen smoked incessantlywhich i thought if i might judge from the smell of their rough coats they must have been doing ever since the coats had first come home from the tailor’s i must not forget that we went on board the yacht where they all three descended into the cabin and were busy with some papers i saw them quite hard at work when i looked down through the open skylight they left me during this time with a very nice man with a very large head of red hair and a very small shiny hat upon it who had got a crossbarred shirt or waistcoat on with ‘skylark’ in capital letters across the chest i thought it was his name and that as he lived on board ship and had not a street door to put his name on he put it there instead but when i called him mr skylark he said it meant the vessel i observed all day that mr murdstone was graver and steadier than the two gentlemen they were very gay and careless they joked freely with one another but seldom with him it appeared to me that he was more clever and cold than they were and that they regarded him with something of my own feeling i remarked that once or twice when mr quinion was talking he looked at mr murdstone sideways as if to make sure of his not being displeased and that once when mr passnidge the other gentleman was in high spirits he trod upon his foot and gave him a secret caution with his eyes to observe mr murdstone who was sitting stern and silent nor do i recollect that mr murdstone laughed at all that day except at the sheffield jokeand that by the by was his own we went home early in the evening it was a very fine evening and my mother and he had another stroll by the sweetbriar while i was sent in to get my tea when he was gone my mother asked me all about the day i had had and what they had said and done i mentioned what they had said about her and she laughed and told me they were impudent fellows who talked nonsensebut i knew it pleased her i knew it quite as well as i know it now i took the opportunity of asking if she was at all acquainted with mr brooks of sheffield but she answered no only she supposed he must be a manufacturer in the knife and fork way can i say of her facealtered as i have reason to remember it perished as i know it isthat it is gone when here it comes before me at this instant as distinct as any face that i may choose to look on in a crowded street can i say of her innocent and girlish beauty that it faded and was no more when its breath falls on my cheek now as it fell that night can i say she ever changed when my remembrance brings her back to life thus only and truer to its loving youth than i have been or man ever is still holds fast what it cherished then i write of her just as she was when i had gone to bed after this talk and she came to bid me good night she kneeled down playfully by the side of the bed and laying her chin upon her hands and laughing said ‘what was it they said davy tell me again i cannot believe it’ ‘“bewitching”’ i began my mother put her hands upon my lips to stop me ‘it was never bewitching’ she said laughing ‘it never could have been bewitching davy now i know it was not’ ‘yes it was “bewitching mrs copperfield”’ i repeated stoutly ‘and “pretty”’ ‘no no it was never pretty not pretty’ interposed my mother laying her fingers on my lips again ‘yes it was “pretty little widow”’ ‘what foolish impudent creatures’ cried my mother laughing and covering her face ‘what ridiculous men an’t they davy dear’ ‘well ma’ ‘do not tell peggotty she might be angry with them i am dreadfully angry with them myself but i would rather peggotty did not know’ i promised of course and we kissed one another over and over again and i soon fell fast asleep it seems to me at this distance of time as if it were the next day when peggotty broached the striking and adventurous proposition i am about to mention but it was probably about two months afterwards we were sitting as before one evening when my mother was out as before in company with the stocking and the yardmeasure and the bit of wax and the box with st paul’s on the lid and the crocodile book when peggotty after looking at me several times and opening her mouth as if she were going to speak without doing itwhich i thought was merely gaping or i should have been rather alarmedsaid coaxingly ‘master davy how should you like to go along with me and spend a fortnight at my brother’s at yarmouth would not that be a treat’ ‘is your brother an agreeable man peggotty’ i inquired provisionally ‘oh what an agreeable man he is’ cried peggotty holding up her hands ‘then there is the sea and the boats and ships and the fishermen and the beach and am to play with’ peggotty meant her nephew ham mentioned in my first she spoke of him as a morsel of english grammar i was flushed by her summary of delights and replied that it would indeed be a treat but what would my mother say ‘why then i will as good as bet a guinea’ said peggotty intent upon my face ‘that she will let us go i will ask her if you like as soon as ever she comes home there now’ ‘but what is she to do while we are away’ said i putting my small elbows on the table to argue the point ‘she cannot live by herself’ if peggotty were looking for a hole all of a sudden in the heel of that stocking it must have been a very little one indeed and not worth darning ‘i say peggotty she cannot live by herself you know’ ‘oh bless you’ said peggotty looking at me again at last ‘do not you know she is going to stay for a fortnight with mrs grayper mrs grayper’s going to have a lot of company’ oh if that was it i was quite ready to go i waited in the utmost impatience until my mother came home from mrs grayper’s for it was that identical neighbour to ascertain if we could get leave to carry out this great idea without being nearly so much surprised as i had expected my mother entered into it readily and it was all arranged that night and my board and lodging during the visit were to be paid for the day soon came for our going it was such an early day that it came soon even to me who was in a fever of expectation and half afraid that an earthquake or a fiery mountain or some other great convulsion of nature might interpose to stop the expedition we were to go in a carrier’s cart which departed in the morning after breakfast i would have given any money to have been allowed to wrap myself up overnight and sleep in my hat and boots it touches me nearly now although i tell it lightly to recollect how eager i was to leave my happy home to think how little i suspected what i did leave for ever i am glad to recollect that when the carrier’s cart was at the gate and my mother stood there kissing me a grateful fondness for her and for the old place i had never turned my back upon before made me cry i am glad to know that my mother cried too and that i felt her heart beat against mine i am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move my mother ran out at the gate and called to him to stop that she might kiss me once more i am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which she lifted up her face to mine and did so as we left her standing in the road mr murdstone came up to where she was and seemed to expostulate with her for being so moved i was looking back round the awning of the cart and wondered what business it was of his peggotty who was also looking back on the other side seemed anything but satisfied as the face she brought back in the cart denoted i sat looking at peggotty for some time in a reverie on this supposititious case whether if she were employed to lose me like the boy in the fairy tale i should be able to track my way home again by the buttons she would she would
