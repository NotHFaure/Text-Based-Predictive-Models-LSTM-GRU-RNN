the beginning of a long journey what is natural in me is natural in many other men i infer and so i am not afraid to write that i never had loved steerforth better than when the ties that bound me to him were broken in the keen distress of the discovery of his unworthiness i thought more of all that was brilliant in him i softened more towards all that was good in him i did more justice to the qualities that might have made him a man of a noble nature and a great name than ever i had done in the height of my devotion to him deeply as i felt my own unconscious part in his pollution of an honest home i believed that if i had been brought face to face with him i could not have uttered one reproach i should have loved him so well stillthough he fascinated me no longeri should have held in so much tenderness the memory of my affection for him that i think i should have been as weak as a spiritwounded child in all but the entertainment of a thought that we could ever be reunited that thought i never had i felt as he had felt that all was at an end between us what his remembrances of me were i have never knownthey were light enough perhaps and easily dismissedbut mine of him were as the remembrances of a cherished friend who was dead yes steerforth long removed from the scenes of this poor history my sorrow may bear involuntary witness against you at the judgement throne but my angry thoughts or my reproaches never will i know the news of what had happened soon spread through the town insomuch that as i passed along the streets next morning i overheard the people speaking of it at their doors many were hard upon her some few were hard upon him but towards her second father and her lover there was but one sentiment among all kinds of people a respect for them in their distress prevailed which was full of gentleness and delicacy the seafaring men kept apart when those two were seen early walking with slow steps on the beach and stood in knots talking compassionately among themselves it was on the beach close down by the sea that i found them it would have been easy to perceive that they had not slept all last night even if peggotty had failed to tell me of their still sitting just as i left them when it was broad day they looked worn and i thought mr peggotty’s head was bowed in one night more than in all the years i had known him but they were both as grave and steady as the sea itself then lying beneath a dark sky wavelessyet with a heavy roll upon it as if it breathed in its restand touched on the horizon with a strip of silvery light from the unseen sun ‘we have had a mort of talk sir’ said mr peggotty to me when we had all three walked a little while in silence ‘of what we ought and doen’t ought to do but we see our course now’ i happened to glance at ham then looking out to sea upon the distant light and a frightful thought came into my mindnot that his face was angry for it was not i recall nothing but an expression of stern determination in itthat if ever he encountered steerforth he would kill him ‘my dooty here sir’ said mr peggotty ‘is done i am a going to seek my’ he stopped and went on in a firmer voice ‘i am a going to seek her that is my dooty evermore’ he shook his head when i asked him where he would seek her and inquired if i were going to london tomorrow i told him i had not gone today fearing to lose the chance of being of any service to him but that i was ready to go when he would ‘i will go along with you sir’ he rejoined ‘if you are agreeable tomorrow’ we walked again for a while in silence ‘ham’ he presently resumed ‘he will hold to his present work and go and live along with my sister the old boat yonder’ ‘will you desert the old boat mr peggotty’ i gently interposed ‘my station mas’r davy’ he returned ‘are not there no longer and if ever a boat foundered since there was darkness on the face of the deep that one’s gone down but no sir no i doen’t mean as it should be deserted fur from that’ we walked again for a while as before until he explained ‘my wishes is sir as it shall look day and night winter and summer as it has always looked since she fust know’d it if ever she should come a wandering back i would not have the old place seem to cast her off you understand but seem to tempt her to draw nigher to ‘t and to peep in maybe like a ghost out of the wind and rain through the old winder at the old seat by the fire then maybe mas’r davy seein’ none but missis gummidge there she might take heart to creep in trembling and might come to be laid down in her old bed and rest her weary head where it was once so gay’ i could not speak to him in reply though i tried ‘every night’ said mr peggotty ‘as reg’lar as the night comes the candle must be stood in its old pane of glass that if ever she should see it it may seem to say “come back my child come back” if ever there is a knock ham partic’ler a soft knock arter dark at your aunt’s door doen’t you go nigh it let it be hernot youthat sees my fallen child’ he walked a little in front of us and kept before us for some minutes during this interval i glanced at ham again and observing the same expression on his face and his eyes still directed to the distant light i touched his arm twice i called him by his name in the tone in which i might have tried to rouse a sleeper before he heeded me when i at last inquired on what his thoughts were so bent he replied ‘on what is afore me mas’r davy and over yon’ ‘on the life before you do you mean’ he had pointed confusedly out to sea ‘ay mas’r davy i doen’t rightly know how ‘it is but from over yon there seemed to me to comethe end of it like’ looking at me as if he were waking but with the same determined face ‘what end’ i asked possessed by my former fear ‘i doen’t know’ he said thoughtfully ‘i was calling to mind that the beginning of it all did take place hereand then the end come but it is gone mas’r davy’ he added answering as i think my look ‘you han’t no call to be afeerd of me but i am kiender muddled i do not fare to feel no matters’which was as much as to say that he was not himself and quite confounded mr peggotty stopping for us to join him we did so and said no more the remembrance of this in connexion with my former thought however haunted me at intervals even until the inexorable end came at its appointed time we insensibly approached the old boat and entered mrs gummidge no longer moping in her especial corner was busy preparing breakfast she took mr peggotty’s hat and placed his seat for him and spoke so comfortably and softly that i hardly knew her ‘dan’l my good man’ said she ‘you must eat and drink and keep up your strength for without it you will do nowt try that is a dear soul an if i disturb you with my clicketten’ she meant her chattering ‘tell me so dan’l and i will not’ when she had served us all she withdrew to the window where she sedulously employed herself in repairing some shirts and other clothes belonging to mr peggotty and neatly folding and packing them in an old oilskin bag such as sailors carry meanwhile she continued talking in the same quiet manner ‘all times and seasons you know dan’l’ said mrs gummidge ‘i shall be allus here and everythink will look accordin’ to your wishes i am a poor scholar but i shall write to you odd times when you are away and send my letters to mas’r davy maybe you will write to me too dan’l odd times and tell me how you fare to feel upon your lone lorn journies’ ‘you will be a solitary woman heer i am afeerd’ said mr peggotty ‘no no dan’l’ she returned ‘i shall not be that doen’t you mind me i shall have enough to do to keep a beein for you’ mrs gummidge meant a home ‘again you come backto keep a beein here for any that may hap to come back dan’l in the fine time i shall set outside the door as i used to do if any should come nigh they shall see the old widder woman true to ‘them a long way off’ what a change in mrs gummidge in a little time she was another woman she was so devoted she had such a quick perception of what it would be well to say and what it would be well to leave unsaid she was so forgetful of herself and so regardful of the sorrow about her that i held her in a sort of veneration the work she did that day there were many things to be brought up from the beach and stored in the outhouseas oars nets sails cordage spars lobsterpots bags of ballast and the like and though there was abundance of assistance rendered there being not a pair of working hands on all that shore but would have laboured hard for mr peggotty and been well paid in being asked to do it yet she persisted all day long in toiling under weights that she was quite unequal to and fagging to and fro on all sorts of unnecessary errands as to deploring her misfortunes she appeared to have entirely lost the recollection of ever having had any she preserved an equable cheerfulness in the midst of her sympathy which was not the least astonishing part of the change that had come over her querulousness was out of the question i did not even observe her voice to falter or a tear to escape from her eyes the whole day through until twilight when she and i and mr peggotty being alone together and he having fallen asleep in perfect exhaustion she broke into a halfsuppressed fit of sobbing and crying and taking me to the door said ‘ever bless you mas’r davy be a friend to him poor dear’ then she immediately ran out of the house to wash her face in order that she might sit quietly beside him and be found at work there when he should awake in short i left her when i went away at night the prop and staff of mr peggotty’s affliction and i could not meditate enough upon the lesson that i read in mrs gummidge and the new experience she unfolded to me it was between nine and ten of the clock when strolling in a melancholy manner through the town i stopped at mr omer’s door mr omer had taken it so much to heart his daughter told me that he had been very low and poorly all day and had gone to bed without his pipe ‘a deceitful badhearted girl’ said mrs joram ‘there was no good in her ever’ ‘do not say so’ i returned ‘you do not think so’ ‘yes i do’ cried mrs joram angrily ‘no no’ said i mrs joram tossed her head endeavouring to be very stern and cross but she could not command her softer self and began to cry i was young to be sure but i thought much the better of her for this sympathy and fancied it became her as a virtuous wife and mother very well indeed ‘what will she ever do’ sobbed minnie ‘where will she go what will become of her oh how could she be so cruel to herself and him’ i remembered the time when minnie was a young and pretty girl and i was glad she remembered it too so feelingly ‘my little minnie’ said mrs joram ‘has only just now been got to sleep even in her sleep she is sobbing for them’ly all day long little minnie has cried for her and asked me over and over again whether them’ly was wicked what can i say to her when them’ly tied a ribbon off her own neck round little minnie’s the last night she was here and laid her head down on the pillow beside her till she was fast asleep the ribbon’s round my little minnie’s neck now it ought not to be perhaps but what can i do them’ly is very bad but they were fond of one another and the child knows nothing’ mrs joram was so unhappy that her husband came out to take care of her leaving them together i went home to peggotty’s more melancholy myself if possible than i had been yet that good creaturei mean peggottyall untired by her late anxieties and sleepless nights was at her brother’s where she meant to stay till morning an old woman who had been employed about the house for some weeks past while peggotty had been unable to attend to it was the house’s only other occupant besides myself as i had no occasion for her services i sent her to bed by no means against her will and sat down before the kitchen fire a little while to think about all this i was blending it with the deathbed of the late mr barkis and was driving out with the tide towards the distance at which ham had looked so singularly in the morning when i was recalled from my wanderings by a knock at the door there was a knocker upon the door but it was not that which made the sound the tap was from a hand and low down upon the door as if it were given by a child it made me start as much as if it had been the knock of a footman to a person of distinction i opened the door and at first looked down to my amazement on nothing but a great umbrella that appeared to be walking about of itself but presently i discovered underneath it miss mowcher i might not have been prepared to give the little creature a very kind reception if on her removing the umbrella which her utmost efforts were unable to shut up she had shown me the ‘volatile’ expression of face which had made so great an impression on me at our first and last meeting but her face as she turned it up to mine was so earnest and when i relieved her of the umbrella which would have been an inconvenient one for the irish giant she wrung her little hands in such an afflicted manner that i rather inclined towards her ‘miss mowcher’ said i after glancing up and down the empty street without distinctly knowing what i expected to see besides ‘how do you come here what is the matter’ she motioned to me with her short right arm to shut the umbrella for her and passing me hurriedly went into the kitchen when i had closed the door and followed with the umbrella in my hand i found her sitting on the corner of the fenderit was a low iron one with two flat bars at top to stand plates uponin the shadow of the boiler swaying herself backwards and forwards and chafing her hands upon her knees like a person in pain quite alarmed at being the only recipient of this untimely visit and the only spectator of this portentous behaviour i exclaimed again ‘pray tell me miss mowcher what is the matter are you ill’ ‘my dear young soul’ returned miss mowcher squeezing her hands upon her heart one over the other ‘i am ill here i am very ill to think that it should come to this when i might have known it and perhaps prevented it if i had not been a thoughtless fool’ again her large bonnet very disproportionate to the figure went backwards and forwards in her swaying of her little body to and fro while a most gigantic bonnet rocked in unison with it upon the wall ‘i am surprised’ i began ‘to see you so distressed and serious’when she interrupted me ‘yes it is always so’ she said ‘they are all surprised these inconsiderate young people fairly and full grown to see any natural feeling in a little thing like me they make a plaything of me use me for their amusement throw me away when they are tired and wonder that i feel more than a toy horse or a wooden soldier yes yes that is the way the old way’ ‘it may be with others’ i returned ‘but i do assure you it is not with me perhaps i ought not to be at all surprised to see you as you are now i know so little of you i said without consideration what i thought’ ‘what can i do’ returned the little woman standing up and holding out her arms to show herself ‘see what i am my father was and my sister is and my brother is i have worked for sister and brother these many yearshard mr copperfieldall day i must live i do no harm if there are people so unreflecting or so cruel as to make a jest of me what is left for me to do but to make a jest of myself them and everything if i do so for the time whose fault is that mine’ no not miss mowcher’s i perceived ‘if i had shown myself a sensitive dwarf to your false friend’ pursued the little woman shaking her head at me with reproachful earnestness ‘how much of his help or good will do you think i should ever have had if little mowcher who had no hand young gentleman in the making of herself addressed herself to him or the like of him because of her misfortunes when do you suppose her small voice would have been heard little mowcher would have as much need to live if she was the bitterest and dullest of pigmies but she could not do it no she might whistle for her bread and butter till she died of air’ miss mowcher sat down on the fender again and took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes ‘be thankful for me if you have a kind heart as i think you have’ she said ‘that while i know well what i am i can be cheerful and endure it all i am thankful for myself at any rate that i can find my tiny way through the world without being beholden to anyone and that in return for all that is thrown at me in folly or vanity as i go along i can throw bubbles back if i do not brood over all i want it is the better for me and not the worse for anyone if i am a plaything for you giants be gentle with me’ miss mowcher replaced her handkerchief in her pocket looking at me with very intent expression all the while and pursued ‘i saw you in the street just now you may suppose i am not able to walk as fast as you with my short legs and short breath and i could not overtake you but i guessed where you came and came after you i have been here before today but the good woman was not at home’ ‘do you know her’ i demanded ‘i know of her and about her’ she replied ‘from omer and joram i was there at seven of the clock this morning do you remember what steerforth said to me about this unfortunate girl that time when i saw you both at the inn’ the great bonnet on miss mowcher’s head and the greater bonnet on the wall began to go backwards and forwards again when she asked this question i remembered very well what she referred to having had it in my thoughts many times that day i told her so ‘may the father of all evil confound him’ said the little woman holding up her forefinger between me and her sparkling eyes ‘and ten times more confound that wicked servant but i believed it was you who had a boyish passion for her’ ‘i’ i repeated ‘child child in the name of blind illfortune’ cried miss mowcher wringing her hands impatiently as she went to and fro again upon the fender ‘why did you praise her so and blush and look disturbed’ i could not conceal from myself that i had done this though for a reason very different from her supposition ‘what did i know’ said miss mowcher taking out her handkerchief again and giving one little stamp on the ground whenever at short intervals she applied it to her eyes with both hands at once ‘he was crossing you and wheedling you i saw and you were soft wax in his hands i saw had i left the room a minute when his man told me that “young innocence” so he called you and you may call him “old guilt” all the days of your life had set his heart upon her and she was giddy and liked him but his master was resolved that no harm should come of itmore for your sake than for hersand that that was their business here how could i but believe him i saw steerforth soothe and please you by his praise of her you were the first to mention her name you owned to an old admiration of her you were hot and cold and red and white all at once when i spoke to you of her what could i thinkwhat did i thinkbut that you were a young libertine in everything but experience and had fallen into hands that had experience enough and could manage you having the fancy for your own good oh oh oh they were afraid of my finding out the truth’ exclaimed miss mowcher getting off the fender and trotting up and down the kitchen with her two short arms distressfully lifted up ‘because i am a sharp little thingi need be to get through the world at alland they deceived me altogether and i gave the poor unfortunate girl a letter which i fully believe was the beginning of her ever speaking to littimer who was left behind on purpose’ i stood amazed at the revelation of all this perfidy looking at miss mowcher as she walked up and down the kitchen until she was out of breath when she sat upon the fender again and drying her face with her handkerchief shook her head for a long time without otherwise moving and without breaking silence ‘my country rounds’ she added at length ‘brought me to norwich mr copperfield the night before last what i happened to find there about their secret way of coming and going without youwhich was strangeled to my suspecting something wrong i got into the coach from london last night as it came through norwich and was here this morning oh oh oh too late’ poor little mowcher turned so chilly after all her crying and fretting that she turned round on the fender putting her poor little wet feet in among the ashes to warm them and sat looking at the fire like a large doll i sat in a chair on the other side of the hearth lost in unhappy reflections and looking at the fire too and sometimes at her ‘i must go’ she said at last rising as she spoke ‘it is late you do not mistrust me’ meeting her sharp glance which was as sharp as ever when she asked me i could not on that short challenge answer no quite frankly ‘come’ said she accepting the offer of my hand to help her over the fender and looking wistfully up into my face ‘you know you would not mistrust me if i was a fullsized woman’ i felt that there was much truth in this and i felt rather ashamed of myself ‘you are a young man’ she said nodding ‘take a word of advice even from three foot nothing try not to associate bodily defects with mental my good friend except for a solid reason’ she had got over the fender now and i had got over my suspicion i told her that i believed she had given me a faithful account of herself and that we had both been hapless instruments in designing hands she thanked me and said i was a good fellow ‘now mind’ she exclaimed turning back on her way to the door and looking shrewdly at me with her forefinger up again‘i have some reason to suspect from what i have heardmy ears are always open i cannot afford to spare what powers i havethat they are gone abroad but if ever they return if ever any one of them returns while i am alive i am more likely than another going about as i do to find it out soon whatever i know you shall know if ever i can do anything to serve the poor betrayed girl i will do it faithfully please heaven and littimer had better have a bloodhound at his back than little mowcher’ i placed implicit faith in this last statement when i marked the look with which it was accompanied ‘trust me no more but trust me no less than you would trust a fullsized woman’ said the little creature touching me appealingly on the wrist ‘if ever you see me again unlike what i am now and like what i was when you first saw me observe what company i am in call to mind that i am a very helpless and defenceless little thing think of me at home with my brother like myself and sister like myself when my day’s work is done perhaps you will not then be very hard upon me or surprised if i can be distressed and serious good night’ i gave miss mowcher my hand with a very different opinion of her from that which i had hitherto entertained and opened the door to let her out it was not a trifling business to get the great umbrella up and properly balanced in her grasp but at last i successfully accomplished this and saw it go bobbing down the street through the rain without the least appearance of having anybody underneath it except when a heavier fall than usual from some overcharged waterspout sent it toppling over on one side and discovered miss mowcher struggling violently to get it right after making one or two sallies to her relief which were rendered futile by the umbrella’s hopping on again like an immense bird before i could reach it i came in went to bed and slept till morning in the morning i was joined by mr peggotty and by my old nurse and we went at an early hour to the coach office where mrs gummidge and ham were waiting to take leave of us ‘mas’r davy’ ham whispered drawing me aside while mr peggotty was stowing his bag among the luggage ‘his life is quite broke up he doen’t know wheer he is going he doen’t knowwhat is afore him he is bound upon a voyage that will last on and off all the rest of his days take my wured for ‘t unless he finds what he is a seeking of i am sure you will be a friend to him mas’r davy’ ‘trust me i will indeed’ said i shaking hands with ham earnestly ‘thankee thankee very kind sir one thing furder i am in good employ you know mas’r davy and i han’t no way now of spending what i gets money’s of no use to me no more except to live if you can lay it out for him i shall do my work with a better art though as to that sir’ and he spoke very steadily and mildly ‘you are not to think but i shall work at all times like a man and act the best that lays in my power’ i told him i was well convinced of it and i hinted that i hoped the time might even come when he would cease to lead the lonely life he naturally contemplated now ‘no sir’ he said shaking his head ‘all that is past and over with me sir no one can never fill the place that is empty but you will bear in mind about the money as theer’s at all times some laying by for him’ reminding him of the fact that mr peggotty derived a steady though certainly a very moderate income from the bequest of his late brotherinlaw i promised to do so we then took leave of each other i cannot leave him even now without remembering with a pang at once his modest fortitude and his great sorrow as to mrs gummidge if i were to endeavour to describe how she ran down the street by the side of the coach seeing nothing but mr peggotty on the roof through the tears she tried to repress and dashing herself against the people who were coming in the opposite direction i should enter on a task of some difficulty therefore i had better leave her sitting on a baker’s doorstep out of breath with no shape at all remaining in her bonnet and one of her shoes off lying on the pavement at a considerable distance when we got to our journey’s end our first pursuit was to look about for a little lodging for peggotty where her brother could have a bed we were so fortunate as to find one of a very clean and cheap description over a chandler’s shop only two streets removed from me when we had engaged this domicile i bought some cold meat at an eatinghouse and took my fellowtravellers home to tea a proceeding i regret to state which did not meet with mrs crupp’s approval but quite the contrary i ought to observe however in explanation of that lady’s state of mind that she was much offended by peggotty’s tucking up her widow’s gown before she had been ten minutes in the place and setting to work to dust my bedroom this mrs crupp regarded in the light of a liberty and a liberty she said was a thing she never allowed mr peggotty had made a communication to me on the way to london for which i was not unprepared it was that he purposed first seeing mrs steerforth as i felt bound to assist him in this and also to mediate between them with the view of sparing the mother’s feelings as much as possible i wrote to her that night i told her as mildly as i could what his wrong was and what my own share in his injury i said he was a man in very common life but of a most gentle and upright character and that i ventured to express a hope that she would not refuse to see him in his heavy trouble i mentioned two of the clock in the afternoon as the hour of our coming and i sent the letter myself by the first coach in the morning at the appointed time we stood at the doorthe door of that house where i had been a few days since so happy where my youthful confidence and warmth of heart had been yielded up so freely which was closed against me henceforth which was now a waste a ruin no littimer appeared the pleasanter face which had replaced his on the occasion of my last visit answered to our summons and went before us to the drawingroom mrs steerforth was sitting there rosa dartle glided as we went in from another part of the room and stood behind her chair i saw directly in his mother’s face that she knew from himself what he had done it was very pale and bore the traces of deeper emotion than my letter alone weakened by the doubts her fondness would have raised upon it would have been likely to create i thought her more like him than ever i had thought her and i felt rather than saw that the resemblance was not lost on my companion she sat upright in her armchair with a stately immovable passionless air that it seemed as if nothing could disturb she looked very steadfastly at mr peggotty when he stood before her and he looked quite as steadfastly at her rosa dartle’s keen glance comprehended all of us for some moments not a word was spoken she motioned to mr peggotty to be seated he said in a low voice ‘i should not feel it nat’ral madam to sit down in this house i would sooner stand’ and this was succeeded by another silence which she broke thus ‘i know with deep regret what has brought you here what do you want of me what do you ask me to do’ he put his hat under his arm and feeling in his breast for emily’s letter took it out unfolded it and gave it to her ‘please to read that madam that is my niece’s hand’ she read it in the same stately and impassive wayuntouched by its contents as far as i could seeand returned it to him ‘“unless he brings me back a lady”’ said mr peggotty tracing out that part with his finger ‘i come to know madam whether he will keep his wured’ ‘no’ she returned ‘why not’ said mr peggotty ‘it is impossible he would disgrace himself you cannot fail to know that she is far below him’ ‘raise her up’ said mr peggotty ‘she is uneducated and ignorant’ ‘maybe she is not maybe she is’ said mr peggotty ‘i think not madam but i am no judge of them things teach her better’ ‘since you oblige me to speak more plainly which i am very unwilling to do her humble connexions would render such a thing impossible if nothing else did’ ‘hark to this madam’ he returned slowly and quietly ‘you know what it is to love your child so do i if she was a hundred times my child i could not love her more you doen’t know what it is to lose your child i do all the heaps of riches in the wureld would be nowt to me if they was mine to buy her back but save her from this disgrace and she shall never be disgraced by us not one of us that she is growed up among not one of us that is lived along with her and had her for their all in all these many year will ever look upon her pritty face again we will be content to let her be we will be content to think of her far off as if she was underneath another sun and sky we will be content to trust her to her husbandto her little children p’rapsand bide the time when all of us shall be alike in quality afore our god’ the rugged eloquence with which he spoke was not devoid of all effect she still preserved her proud manner but there was a touch of softness in her voice as she answered ‘i justify nothing i make no counteraccusations but i am sorry to repeat it is impossible such a marriage would irretrievably blight my son’s career and ruin his prospects nothing is more certain than that it never can take place and never will if there is any other compensation’ ‘i am looking at the likeness of the face’ interrupted mr peggotty with a steady but a kindling eye ‘that has looked at me in my home at my fireside in my boatwheer notsmiling and friendly when it was so treacherous that i go half wild when i think of it if the likeness of that face do not turn to burning fire at the thought of offering money to me for my child’s blight and ruin it is as bad i doen’t know being a lady’s but what it is worse’ she changed now in a moment an angry flush overspread her features and she said in an intolerant manner grasping the armchair tightly with her hands ‘what compensation can you make to me for opening such a pit between me and my son what is your love to mine what is your separation to ours’ miss dartle softly touched her and bent down her head to whisper but she would not hear a word ‘no rosa not a word let the man listen to what i say my son who has been the object of my life to whom its every thought has been devoted whom i have gratified from a child in every wish from whom i have had no separate existence since his birthto take up in a moment with a miserable girl and avoid me to repay my confidence with systematic deception for her sake and quit me for her to set this wretched fancy against his mother’s claims upon his duty love respect gratitudeclaims that every day and hour of his life should have strengthened into ties that nothing could be proof against is this no injury’ again rosa dartle tried to soothe her again ineffectually ‘i say rosa not a word if he can stake his all upon the lightest object i can stake my all upon a greater purpose let him go where he will with the means that my love has secured to him does he think to reduce me by long absence he knows his mother very little if he does let him put away his whim now and he is welcome back let him not put her away now and he never shall come near me living or dying while i can raise my hand to make a sign against it unless being rid of her for ever he comes humbly to me and begs for my forgiveness this is my right this is the acknowledgement i will have this is the separation that there is between us and is this’ she added looking at her visitor with the proud intolerant air with which she had begun ‘no injury’ while i heard and saw the mother as she said these words i seemed to hear and see the son defying them all that i had ever seen in him of an unyielding wilful spirit i saw in her all the understanding that i had now of his misdirected energy became an understanding of her character too and a perception that it was in its strongest springs the same she now observed to me aloud resuming her former restraint that it was useless to hear more or to say more and that she begged to put an end to the interview she rose with an air of dignity to leave the room when mr peggotty signified that it was needless ‘doen’t fear me being any hindrance to you i have no more to say madam’ he remarked as he moved towards the door ‘i come heer with no hope and i take away no hope i have done what i thowt should be done but i never looked fur any good to come of my stan’ning where i do this has been too evil a house fur me and mine fur me to be in my right senses and expect it’ with this we departed leaving her standing by her elbowchair a picture of a noble presence and a handsome face we had on our way out to cross a paved hall with glass sides and roof over which a vine was trained its leaves and shoots were green then and the day being sunny a pair of glass doors leading to the garden were thrown open rosa dartle entering this way with a noiseless step when we were close to them addressed herself to me ‘you do well’ she said ‘indeed to bring this fellow here’ such a concentration of rage and scorn as darkened her face and flashed in her jetblack eyes i could not have thought compressible even into that face the scar made by the hammer was as usual in this excited state of her features strongly marked when the throbbing i had seen before came into it as i looked at her she absolutely lifted up her hand and struck it ‘this is a fellow’ she said ‘to champion and bring here is he not you are a true man’ ‘miss dartle’ i returned ‘you are surely not so unjust as to condemn me’ ‘why do you bring division between these two mad creatures’ she returned ‘do not you know that they are both mad with their own selfwill and pride’ ‘is it my doing’ i returned ‘is it your doing’ she retorted ‘why do you bring this man here’ ‘he is a deeplyinjured man miss dartle’ i replied ‘you may not know it’ ‘i know that james steerforth’ she said with her hand on her bosom as if to prevent the storm that was raging there from being loud ‘has a false corrupt heart and is a traitor but what need i know or care about this fellow and his common niece’ ‘miss dartle’ i returned ‘you deepen the injury it is sufficient already i will only say at parting that you do him a great wrong’ ‘i do him no wrong’ she returned ‘they are a depraved worthless set i would have her whipped’ mr peggotty passed on without a word and went out at the door ‘oh shame miss dartle shame’ i said indignantly ‘how can you bear to trample on his undeserved affliction’ ‘i would trample on them all’ she answered ‘i would have his house pulled down i would have her branded on the face dressed in rags and cast out in the streets to starve if i had the power to sit in judgement on her i would see it done see it done i would do it i detest her if i ever could reproach her with her infamous condition i would go anywhere to do so if i could hunt her to her grave i would if there was any word of comfort that would be a solace to her in her dying hour and only i possessed it i would not part with it for life itself’ the mere vehemence of her words can convey i am sensible but a weak impression of the passion by which she was possessed and which made itself articulate in her whole figure though her voice instead of being raised was lower than usual no description i could give of her would do justice to my recollection of her or to her entire deliverance of herself to her anger i have seen passion in many forms but i have never seen it in such a form as that when i joined mr peggotty he was walking slowly and thoughtfully down the hill he told me as soon as i came up with him that having now discharged his mind of what he had purposed doing in london he meant ‘to set out on his travels’ that night i asked him where he meant to go he only answered ‘i am a going sir to seek my niece’ we went back to the little lodging over the chandler’s shop and there i found an opportunity of repeating to peggotty what he had said to me she informed me in return that he had said the same to her that morning she knew no more than i did where he was going but she thought he had some project shaped out in his mind i did not like to leave him under such circumstances and we all three dined together off a beefsteak piewhich was one of the many good things for which peggotty was famousand which was curiously flavoured on this occasion i recollect well by a miscellaneous taste of tea coffee butter bacon cheese new loaves firewood candles and walnut ketchup continually ascending from the shop after dinner we sat for an hour or so near the window without talking much and then mr peggotty got up and brought his oilskin bag and his stout stick and laid them on the table he accepted from his sister’s stock of ready money a small sum on account of his legacy barely enough i should have thought to keep him for a month he promised to communicate with me when anything befell him and he slung his bag about him took his hat and stick and bade us both ‘goodbye’ ‘all good attend you dear old woman’ he said embracing peggotty ‘and you too mas’r davy’ shaking hands with me ‘i am agoing to seek her fur and wide if she should come home while i am awaybut ah that are not like to beor if i should bring her back my meaning is that she and me shall live and die where no one cannot reproach her if any hurt should come to me remember that the last words i left for her was “my unchanged love is with my darling child and i forgive her”’ he said this solemnly bareheaded then putting on his hat he went down the stairs and away we followed to the door it was a warm dusty evening just the time when in the great main thoroughfare out of which that byway turned there was a temporary lull in the eternal tread of feet upon the pavement and a strong red sunshine he turned alone at the corner of our shady street into a glow of light in which we lost him rarely did that hour of the evening come rarely did i wake at night rarely did i look up at the moon or stars or watch the falling rain or hear the wind but i thought of his solitary figure toiling on poor pilgrim and recalled the words ‘i am a going to seek her fur and wide if any hurt should come to me remember that the last words i left for her was “my unchanged love is with my darling child and i forgive her”’
