a greater loss it was not difficult for me on peggotty’s solicitation to resolve to stay where i was until after the remains of the poor carrier should have made their last journey to blunderstone she had long ago bought out of her own savings a little piece of ground in our old churchyard near the grave of ‘her sweet girl’ as she always called my mother and there they were to rest in keeping peggotty company and doing all i could for her little enough at the utmost i was as grateful i rejoice to think as even now i could wish myself to have been but i am afraid i had a supreme satisfaction of a personal and professional nature in taking charge of mr barkis’s will and expounding its contents i may claim the merit of having originated the suggestion that the will should be looked for in the box after some search it was found in the box at the bottom of a horse’s nosebag wherein besides hay there was discovered an old gold watch with chain and seals which mr barkis had worn on his weddingday and which had never been seen before or since a silver tobaccostopper in the form of a leg an imitation lemon full of minute cups and saucers which i have some idea mr barkis must have purchased to present to me when i was a child and afterwards found himself unable to part with eightyseven guineas and a half in guineas and halfguineas two hundred and ten pounds in perfectly clean bank notes certain receipts for bank of england stock an old horseshoe a bad shilling a piece of camphor and an oystershe will from the circumstance of the latter article having been much polished and displaying prismatic colours on the inside i conclude that mr barkis had some general ideas about pearls which never resolved themselves into anything definite for years and years mr barkis had carried this box on all his journeys every day that it might the better escape notice he had invented a fiction that it belonged to ‘mr blackboy’ and was ‘to be left with barkis till called for’ a fable he had elaborately written on the lid in characters now scarcely legible he had hoarded all these years i found to good purpose his property in money amounted to nearly three thousand pounds of this he bequeathed the interest of one thousand to mr peggotty for his life on his decease the principal to be equally divided between peggotty little emily and me or the survivor or survivors of us share and share alike all the rest he died possessed of he bequeathed to peggotty whom he left residuary legatee and sole executrix of that his last will and testament i felt myself quite a proctor when i read this document aloud with all possible ceremony and set forth its provisions any number of times to those whom they concerned i began to think there was more in the commons than i had supposed i examined the will with the deepest attention pronounced it perfectly formal in all respects made a pencilmark or so in the margin and thought it rather extraordinary that i knew so much in this abstruse pursuit in making an account for peggotty of all the property into which she had come in arranging all the affairs in an orderly manner and in being her referee and adviser on every point to our joint delight i passed the week before the funeral i did not see little emily in that interval but they told me she was to be quietly married in a fortnight i did not attend the funeral in character if i may venture to say so i mean i was not dressed up in a black coat and a streamer to frighten the birds but i walked over to blunderstone early in the morning and was in the churchyard when it came attended only by peggotty and her brother the mad gentleman looked on out of my little window mr chillip’s baby wagged its heavy head and rolled its goggle eyes at the clergyman over its nurse’s shoulder mr omer breathed short in the background no one else was there and it was very quiet we walked about the churchyard for an hour after all was over and pulled some young leaves from the tree above my mother’s grave a dread falls on me here a cloud is lowering on the distant town towards which i retraced my solitary steps i fear to approach it i cannot bear to think of what did come upon that memorable night of what must come again if i go on it is no worse because i write of it it would be no better if i stopped my most unwilling hand it is done nothing can undo it nothing can make it otherwise than as it was my old nurse was to go to london with me next day on the business of the will little emily was passing that day at mr omer’s we were all to meet in the old boathouse that night ham would bring emily at the usual hour i would walk back at my leisure the brother and sister would return as they had come and be expecting us when the day closed in at the fireside i parted from them at the wicketgate where visionary strap had rested with roderick random’s knapsack in the days of yore and instead of going straight back walked a little distance on the road to lowestoft then i turned and walked back towards yarmouth i stayed to dine at a decent alehouse some mile or two from the ferry i have mentioned before and thus the day wore away and it was evening when i reached it rain was falling heavily by that time and it was a wild night but there was a moon behind the clouds and it was not dark i was soon within sight of mr peggotty’s house and of the light within it shining through the window a little floundering across the sand which was heavy brought me to the door and i went in it looked very comfortable indeed mr peggotty had smoked his evening pipe and there were preparations for some supper by and by the fire was bright the ashes were thrown up the locker was ready for little emily in her old place in her own old place sat peggotty once more looking but for her dress as if she had never left it she had fallen back already on the society of the workbox with st paul’s upon the lid the yardmeasure in the cottage and the bit of waxcandle and there they all were just as if they had never been disturbed mrs gummidge appeared to be fretting a little in her old corner and consequently looked quite natural too ‘you are first of the lot mas’r davy’ said mr peggotty with a happy face ‘doen’t keep in that coat sir if it is wet’ ‘thank you mr peggotty’ said i giving him my outer coat to hang up ‘it is quite dry’ ‘so ‘it is’ said mr peggotty feeling my shoulders ‘as a chip sit ye down sir it are not of no use saying welcome to you but you are welcome kind and hearty’ ‘thank you mr peggotty i am sure of that well peggotty’ said i giving her a kiss ‘and how are you old woman’ ‘ha ha’ laughed mr peggotty sitting down beside us and rubbing his hands in his sense of relief from recent trouble and in the genuine heartiness of his nature ‘there is not a woman in the wureld siras i tell herthat need to feel more easy in her mind than her she done her dooty by the departed and the departed know’d it and the departed done what was right by her as she done what was right by the departedandandand it is all right’ mrs gummidge groaned ‘cheer up my pritty mawther’ said mr peggotty but he shook his head aside at us evidently sensible of the tendency of the late occurrences to recall the memory of the old one ‘doen’t be down cheer up for your own self on’y a little bit and see if a good deal more doen’t come nat’ral’ ‘not to me dan’l’ returned mrs gummidge ‘nothink’s nat’ral to me but to be lone and lorn’ ‘no no’ said mr peggotty soothing her sorrows ‘yes yes dan’l’ said mrs gummidge ‘i are not a person to live with them as has had money left things go too contrary with me i had better be a riddance’ ‘why how should i ever spend it without you’ said mr peggotty with an air of serious remonstrance ‘what are you a talking on doen’t i want you more now than ever i did’ ‘i know’d i was never wanted before’ cried mrs gummidge with a pitiable whimper ‘and now i am told so how could i expect to be wanted being so lone and lorn and so contrary’ mr peggotty seemed very much shocked at himself for having made a speech capable of this unfeeling construction but was prevented from replying by peggotty’s pulling his sleeve and shaking her head after looking at mrs gummidge for some moments in sore distress of mind he glanced at the dutch clock rose snuffed the candle and put it in the window ‘theer’ said mr peggotty cheerily ‘theer we are missis gummidge’ mrs gummidge slightly groaned ‘lighted up accordin’ to custom you are a wonderin’ what that is fur sir well it is fur our little them’ly you see the path are not over light or cheerful arter dark and when i am here at the hour as she is a comin’ home i puts the light in the winder that you see’ said mr peggotty bending over me with great glee ‘meets two objects she says says them’ly “theer’s home” she says and likewise says them’ly “my uncle’s theer” fur if i are not theer i never have no light showed’ ‘you are a baby’ said peggotty very fond of him for it if she thought so ‘well’ returned mr peggotty standing with his legs pretty wide apart and rubbing his hands up and down them in his comfortable satisfaction as he looked alternately at us and at the fire ‘i doen’t know but i am not you see to look at’ ‘not azackly’ observed peggotty ‘no’ laughed mr peggotty ‘not to look at but toto consider on you know i doen’t care bless you now i tell you when i go a looking and looking about that theer pritty house of our them’ly’s i ami am gormed’ said mr peggotty with sudden emphasis‘theer i cannot say moreif i doen’t feel as if the littlest things was her a’most i takes ‘them up and i put ‘them down and i touches of ‘them as delicate as if they was our them’ly so ‘it is with her little bonnets and that i could not see one on ‘them rough used a purposenot fur the whole wureld there is a babby fur you in the form of a great sea porkypine’ said mr peggotty relieving his earnestness with a roar of laughter peggotty and i both laughed but not so loud ‘it is my opinion you see’ said mr peggotty with a delighted face after some further rubbing of his legs ‘as this is along of my having played with her so much and made believe as we was turks and french and sharks and every wariety of forinnersbless you yes and lions and whales and i doen’t know what allwhen she warn’t no higher than my knee i have got into the way on it you know why this here candle now’ said mr peggotty gleefully holding out his hand towards it ‘i know wery well that arter she is married and gone i shall put that candle theer just the same as now i know wery well that when i am here of nights and where else should i live bless your arts whatever fortun’ i come into and she are not here or i are not theer i shall put the candle in the winder and sit afore the fire pretending i am expecting of her like i am a doing now there is a babby for you’ said mr peggotty with another roar ‘in the form of a sea porkypine why at the present minute when i see the candle sparkle up i says to myself “she is a looking at it them’ly’s a coming” there is a babby for you in the form of a sea porkypine right for all that’ said mr peggotty stopping in his roar and smiting his hands together ‘fur here she is’ it was only ham the night should have turned more wet since i came in for he had a large sou’wester hat on slouched over his face ‘wheer’s them’ly’ said mr peggotty ham made a motion with his head as if she were outside mr peggotty took the light from the window trimmed it put it on the table and was busily stirring the fire when ham who had not moved said ‘mas’r davy will you come out a minute and see what them’ly and me has got to show you’ we went out as i passed him at the door i saw to my astonishment and fright that he was deadly pale he pushed me hastily into the open air and closed the door upon us only upon us two ‘ham what is the matter’ ‘mas’r davy’ oh for his broken heart how dreadfully he wept i was paralysed by the sight of such grief i do not know what i thought or what i dreaded i could only look at him ‘ham poor good fellow for heaven’s sake tell me what is the matter’ ‘my love mas’r davythe pride and hope of my arther that i would have died for and would die for nowshe is gone’ ‘gone’ ‘them’ly’s run away oh mas’r davy think how she is run away when i pray my good and gracious god to kill her her that is so dear above all things sooner than let her come to ruin and disgrace’ the face he turned up to the troubled sky the quivering of his clasped hands the agony of his figure remain associated with the lonely waste in my remembrance to this hour it is always night there and he is the only object in the scene ‘you are a scholar’ he said hurriedly ‘and know what is right and best what am i to say indoors how am i ever to break it to him mas’r davy’ i saw the door move and instinctively tried to hold the latch on the outside to gain a moment’s time it was too late mr peggotty thrust forth his face and never could i forget the change that came upon it when he saw us if i were to live five hundred years i remember a great wail and cry and the women hanging about him and we all standing in the room i with a paper in my hand which ham had given me mr peggotty with his vest torn open his hair wild his face and lips quite white and blood trickling down his bosom it had sprung from his mouth i think looking fixedly at me ‘read it sir’ he said in a low shivering voice ‘slow please i doen’t know as i can understand’ in the midst of the silence of death i read thus from a blotted letter ‘“when you who love me so much better than i ever have deserved even when my mind was innocent see this i shall be far away”’ ‘i shall be fur away’ he repeated slowly ‘stop them’ly fur away well’ ‘“when i leave my dear homemy dear homeoh my dear homein the morning”’ the letter bore date on the previous night ‘“it will be never to come back unless he brings me back a lady this will be found at night many hours after instead of me oh if you knew how my heart is torn if even you that i have wronged so much that never can forgive me could only know what i suffer i am too wicked to write about myself oh take comfort in thinking that i am so bad oh for mercy’s sake tell uncle that i never loved him half so dear as now oh do not remember how affectionate and kind you have all been to medo not remember we were ever to be marriedbut try to think as if i died when i was little and was buried somewhere pray heaven that i am going away from have compassion on my uncle tell him that i never loved him half so dear be his comfort love some good girl that will be what i was once to uncle and be true to you and worthy of you and know no shame but me god bless all i will pray for all often on my knees if he do not bring me back a lady and i do not pray for my own self i will pray for all my parting love to uncle my last tears and my last thanks for uncle”’ that was all he stood long after i had ceased to read still looking at me at length i ventured to take his hand and to entreat him as well as i could to endeavour to get some command of himself he replied ‘i thankee sir i thankee’ without moving ham spoke to him mr peggotty was so far sensible of his affliction that he wrung his hand but otherwise he remained in the same state and no one dared to disturb him slowly at last he moved his eyes from my face as if he were waking from a vision and cast them round the room then he said in a low voice ‘who is the man i want to know his name’ ham glanced at me and suddenly i felt a shock that struck me back ‘there is a man suspected’ said mr peggotty ‘who is it’ ‘mas’r davy’ implored ham ‘go out a bit and let me tell him what i must you doen’t ought to hear it sir’ i felt the shock again i sank down in a chair and tried to utter some reply but my tongue was fettered and my sight was weak ‘i want to know his name’ i heard said once more ‘for some time past’ ham faltered ‘there is been a servant about here at odd times there is been a gen’lm’n too both of ‘them belonged to one another’ mr peggotty stood fixed as before but now looking at him ‘the servant’ pursued ham ‘was seen along withour poor girllast night he is been in hiding about here this week or over he was thought to have gone but he was hiding doen’t stay mas’r davy doen’t’ i felt peggotty’s arm round my neck but i could not have moved if the house had been about to fall upon me ‘a strange chay and hosses was outside town this morning on the norwich road a’most afore the day broke’ ham went on ‘the servant went to it and come from it and went to it again when he went to it again them’ly was nigh him the t’other was inside he is the man’ ‘for the lord’s love’ said mr peggotty falling back and putting out his hand as if to keep off what he dreaded ‘doen’t tell me his name’s steerforth’ ‘mas’r davy’ exclaimed ham in a broken voice ‘it are not no fault of yournand i am far from laying of it to youbut his name is steerforth and he is a damned villain’ mr peggotty uttered no cry and she would no tear and moved no more until he seemed to wake again all at once and pulled down his rough coat from its peg in a corner ‘bear a hand with this i am struck of a heap and cannot do it’ he said impatiently ‘bear a hand and help me well’ when somebody had done so ‘now give me that theer hat’ ham asked him whither he was going ‘i am a going to seek my niece i am a going to seek my them’ly i am a going first to stave in that theer boat and sink it where i would have drownded him as i am a living soul if i had had one thought of what was in him as he sat afore me’ he said wildly holding out his clenched right hand ‘as he sat afore me face to face strike me down dead but i would have drownded him and thought it righti am a going to seek my niece’ ‘where’ cried ham interposing himself before the door ‘anywhere i am a going to seek my niece through the wureld i am a going to find my poor niece in her shame and bring her back no one stop me i tell you i am a going to seek my niece’ ‘no no’ cried mrs gummidge coming between them in a fit of crying ‘no no dan’l not as you are now seek her in a little while my lone lorn dan’l and that will be but right but not as you are now sit ye down and give me your forgiveness for having ever been a worrit to you dan’lwhat have my contraries ever been to thisand let us speak a word about them times when she was first an orphan and when ham was too and when i was a poor widder woman and you took me in it will soften your poor heart dan’l’ laying her head upon his shoulder ‘and you will bear your sorrow better for you know the promise dan’l “as you have done it unto one of the least of these you have done it unto me”and that can never fail under this roof that is been our shelter for so many many year’ he was quite passive now and when i heard him crying the impulse that had been upon me to go down upon my knees and ask their pardon for the desolation i had caused and curse steerforth yielded to a better feeling my overcharged heart found the same relief and i cried too
