a dissolution of partnership i did not allow my resolution with respect to the parliamentary debates to cool it was one of the irons i began to heat immediately and one of the irons i kept hot and hammered at with a perseverance i may honestly admire i bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography which cost me ten and sixpence and plunged into a sea of perplexity that brought me in a few weeks to the confines of distraction the changes that were rung upon dots which in such a position meant such a thing and in such another position something else entirely different the wonderful vagaries that were played by circles the unaccountable consequences that resulted from marks like flies’ legs the tremendous effects of a curve in a wrong place not only troubled my waking hours but reappeared before me in my sleep when i had groped my way blindly through these difficulties and had mastered the alphabet which was an egyptian temple in itself there then appeared a procession of new horrors called arbitrary characters the most despotic characters i have ever known who insisted for instance that a thing like the beginning of a cobweb meant expectation and that a penandink skyrocket stood for disadvantageous when i had fixed these wretches in my mind i found that they had driven everything else out of it then beginning again i forgot them while i was picking them up i dropped the other fragments of the system in short it was almost heartbreaking it might have been quite heartbreaking but for dora who was the stay and anchor of my tempestdriven bark every scratch in the scheme was a gnarled oak in the forest of difficulty and i went on cutting them down one after another with such vigour that in three or four months i was in a condition to make an experiment on one of our crack speakers in the commons shall i ever forget how the crack speaker walked off from me before i began and left my imbecile pencil staggering about the paper as if it were in a fit this would not do it was quite clear i was flying too high and should never get on so i resorted to traddles for advice who suggested that he should dictate speeches to me at a pace and with occasional stoppages adapted to my weakness very grateful for this friendly aid i accepted the proposal and night after night almost every night for a long time we had a sort of private parliament in buckingham street after i came home from the doctor’s i should like to see such a parliament anywhere else my aunt and mr dick represented the government or the opposition as the case might be and traddles with the assistance of enfield’s speakers or a volume of parliamentary orations thundered astonishing invectives against them standing by the table with his finger in the page to keep the place and his right arm flourishing above his head traddles as mr pitt mr fox mr sheridan mr burke lord castlereagh viscount sidmouth or mr canning would work himself into the most violent heats and deliver the most withering denunciations of the profligacy and corruption of my aunt and mr dick while i used to sit at a little distance with my notebook on my knee fagging after him with all my might and main the inconsistency and recklessness of traddles were not to be exceeded by any real politician he was for any description of policy in the compass of a week and nailed all sorts of colours to every denomination of mast my aunt looking very like an immovable chancellor of the exchequer would occasionally throw in an interruption or two as ‘hear’ or ‘no’ or ‘oh’ when the text seemed to require it which was always a signal to mr dick a perfect country gentleman to follow lustily with the same cry but mr dick got taxed with such things in the course of his parliamentary career and was made responsible for such awful consequences that he became uncomfortable in his mind sometimes i believe he actually began to be afraid he really had been doing something tending to the annihilation of the british constitution and the ruin of the country often and often we pursued these debates until the clock pointed to midnight and the candles were burning down the result of so much good practice was that by and by i began to keep pace with traddles pretty well and should have been quite triumphant if i had had the least idea what my notes were about but as to reading them after i had got them i might as well have copied the chinese inscriptions of an immense collection of teachests or the golden characters on all the great red and green bottles in the chemists’ shops there was nothing for it but to turn back and begin all over again it was very hard but i turned back though with a heavy heart and began laboriously and methodically to plod over the same tedious ground at a snail’s pace stopping to examine minutely every speck in the way on all sides and making the most desperate efforts to know these elusive characters by sight wherever i met them i was always punctual at the office at the doctor’s too and i really did work as the common expression is like a carthorse one day when i went to the commons as usual i found mr spenlow in the doorway looking extremely grave and talking to himself as he was in the habit of complaining of pains in his headhe had naturally a short throat and i do seriously believe he overstarched himselfi was at first alarmed by the idea that he was not quite right in that direction but he soon relieved my uneasiness instead of returning my ‘good morning’ with his usual affability he looked at me in a distant ceremonious manner and coldly requested me to accompany him to a certain coffeehouse which in those days had a door opening into the commons just within the little archway in st paul’s churchyard i complied in a very uncomfortable state and with a warm shooting all over me as if my apprehensions were breaking out into buds when i allowed him to go on a little before on account of the narrowness of the way i observed that he carried his head with a lofty air that was particularly unpromising and my mind misgave me that he had found out about my darling dora if i had not guessed this on the way to the coffeehouse i could hardly have failed to know what was the matter when i followed him into an upstairs room and found miss murdstone there supported by a background of sideboard on which were several inverted tumblers sustaining lemons and two of those extraordinary boxes all corners and flutings for sticking knives and forks in which happily for mankind are now obsolete miss murdstone gave me her chilly fingernails and sat severely rigid mr spenlow shut the door motioned me to a chair and stood on the hearthrug in front of the fireplace ‘have the goodness to show mr copperfield’ said mr spenlow what you have in your reticule miss murdstone’ i believe it was the old identical steelclasped reticule of my childhood that shut up like a bite compressing her lips in sympathy with the snap miss murdstone opened itopening her mouth a little at the same timeand produced my last letter to dora teeming with expressions of devoted affection ‘i believe that is your writing mr copperfield’ said mr spenlow i was very hot and the voice i heard was very unlike mine when i said ‘it is sir’ ‘if i am not mistaken’ said mr spenlow as miss murdstone brought a parcel of letters out of her reticule tied round with the dearest bit of blue ribbon ‘those are also from your pen mr copperfield’ i took them from her with a most desolate sensation and glancing at such phrases at the top as ‘my ever dearest and own dora’ ‘my best beloved angel’ ‘my blessed one for ever’ and the like blushed deeply and inclined my head ‘no thank you’ said mr spenlow coldly as i mechanically offered them back to him ‘i will not deprive you of them miss murdstone be so good as to proceed’ that gentle creature after a moment’s thoughtful survey of the carpet delivered herself with much dry unction as follows ‘i must confess to having entertained my suspicions of miss spenlow in reference to david copperfield for some time i observed miss spenlow and david copperfield when they first met and the impression made upon me then was not agreeable the depravity of the human heart is such’ ‘you will oblige me madam’ interrupted mr spenlow ‘by confining yourself to facts’ miss murdstone cast down her eyes shook her head as if protesting against this unseemly interruption and with frowning dignity resumed ‘since i am to confine myself to facts i will state them as dryly as i can perhaps that will be considered an acceptable course of proceeding i have already said sir that i have had my suspicions of miss spenlow in reference to david copperfield for some time i have frequently endeavoured to find decisive corroboration of those suspicions but without effect i have therefore forborne to mention them to miss spenlow’s father’ looking severely at him‘knowing how little disposition there usually is in such cases to acknowledge the conscientious discharge of duty’ mr spenlow seemed quite cowed by the gentlemanly sternness of miss murdstone’s manner and deprecated her severity with a conciliatory little wave of his hand ‘on my return to norwood after the period of absence occasioned by my brother’s marriage’ pursued miss murdstone in a disdainful voice ‘and on the return of miss spenlow from her visit to her friend miss mills i imagined that the manner of miss spenlow gave me greater occasion for suspicion than before therefore i watched miss spenlow closely’ dear tender little dora so unconscious of this dragon’s eye ‘still’ resumed miss murdstone ‘i found no proof until last night it appeared to me that miss spenlow received too many letters from her friend miss mills but miss mills being her friend with her father’s full concurrence’ another telling blow at mr spenlow ‘it was not for me to interfere if i may not be permitted to allude to the natural depravity of the human heart at least i mayi mustbe permitted so far to refer to misplaced confidence’ mr spenlow apologetically murmured his assent ‘last evening after tea’ pursued miss murdstone ‘i observed the little dog starting rolling and growling about the drawingroom worrying something i said to miss spenlow “dora what is that the dog has in his mouth it is paper” miss spenlow immediately put her hand to her frock gave a sudden cry and ran to the dog i interposed and said “dora my love you must permit me”’ oh jip miserable spaniel this wretchedness then was your work ‘miss spenlow endeavoured’ said miss murdstone ‘to bribe me with kisses workboxes and small articles of jewellerythat of course i pass over the little dog retreated under the sofa on my approaching him and was with great difficulty dislodged by the fireirons even when dislodged he still kept the letter in his mouth and on my endeavouring to take it from him at the imminent risk of being bitten he kept it between his teeth so pertinaciously as to suffer himself to be held suspended in the air by means of the document at length i obtained possession of it after perusing it i taxed miss spenlow with having many such letters in her possession and ultimately obtained from her the packet which is now in david copperfield’s hand’ here she ceased and snapping her reticule again and shutting her mouth looked as if she might be broken but could never be bent ‘you have heard miss murdstone’ said mr spenlow turning to me ‘i beg to ask mr copperfield if you have anything to say in reply’ the picture i had before me of the beautiful little treasure of my heart sobbing and crying all nightof her being alone frightened and wretched thenof her having so piteously begged and prayed that stonyhearted woman to forgive herof her having vainly offered her those kisses workboxes and trinketsof her being in such grievous distress and all for mevery much impaired the little dignity i had been able to muster i am afraid i was in a tremulous state for a minute or so though i did my best to disguise it ‘there is nothing i can say sir’ i returned ‘except that all the blame is mine dora’ ‘miss spenlow if you please’ said her father majestically ‘was induced and persuaded by me’ i went on swallowing that colder designation ‘to consent to this concealment and i bitterly regret it’ ‘you are very much to blame sir’ said mr spenlow walking to and fro upon the hearthrug and emphasizing what he said with his whole body instead of his head on account of the stiffness of his cravat and spine ‘you have done a stealthy and unbecoming action mr copperfield when i take a gentleman to my house no matter whether he is nineteen twentynine or ninety i take him there in a spirit of confidence if he abuses my confidence he commits a dishonourable action mr copperfield’ ‘i feel it sir i assure you’ i returned ‘but i never thought so before sincerely honestly indeed mr spenlow i never thought so before i love miss spenlow to that extent’ ‘pooh nonsense’ said mr spenlow reddening ‘pray do not tell me to my face that you love my daughter mr copperfield’ ‘could i defend my conduct if i did not sir’ i returned with all humility ‘can you defend your conduct if you do sir’ said mr spenlow stopping short upon the hearthrug ‘have you considered your years and my daughter’s years mr copperfield have you considered what it is to undermine the confidence that should subsist between my daughter and myself have you considered my daughter’s station in life the projects i may contemplate for her advancement the testamentary intentions i may have with reference to her have you considered anything mr copperfield’ ‘very little sir i am afraid’ i answered speaking to him as respectfully and sorrowfully as i felt ‘but pray believe me i have considered my own worldly position when i explained it to you we were already engaged’ ‘i beg’ said mr spenlow more like punch than i had ever seen him as he energetically struck one hand upon the otheri could not help noticing that even in my despair ‘that you will not talk to me of engagements mr copperfield’ the otherwise immovable miss murdstone laughed contemptuously in one short syllable ‘when i explained my altered position to you sir’ i began again substituting a new form of expression for what was so unpalatable to him ‘this concealment into which i am so unhappy as to have led miss spenlow had begun since i have been in that altered position i have strained every nerve i have exerted every energy to improve it i am sure i shall improve it in time will you grant me timeany length of time we are both so young sir’ ‘you are right’ interrupted mr spenlow nodding his head a great many times and frowning very much ‘you are both very young it is all nonsense let there be an end of the nonsense take away those letters and throw them in the fire give me miss spenlow’s letters to throw in the fire and although our future intercourse must you are aware be restricted to the commons here we will agree to make no further mention of the past come mr copperfield you do not want sense and this is the sensible course’ no i could not think of agreeing to it i was very sorry but there was a higher consideration than sense love was above all earthly considerations and i loved dora to idolatry and dora loved me i did not exactly say so i softened it down as much as i could but i implied it and i was resolute upon it i do not think i made myself very ridiculous but i know i was resolute ‘very well mr copperfield’ said mr spenlow ‘i must try my influence with my daughter’ miss murdstone by an expressive sound a long drawn respiration which was neither a sigh nor a moan but was like both gave it as her opinion that he should have done this at first ‘i must try’ said mr spenlow confirmed by this support ‘my influence with my daughter do you decline to take those letters mr copperfield’ for i had laid them on the table yes i told him i hoped he would not think it wrong but i could not possibly take them from miss murdstone ‘nor from me’ said mr spenlow no i replied with the profoundest respect nor from him ‘very well’ said mr spenlow a silence succeeding i was undecided whether to go or stay at length i was moving quietly towards the door with the intention of saying that perhaps i should consult his feelings best by withdrawing when he said with his hands in his coat pockets into which it was as much as he could do to get them and with what i should call upon the whole a decidedly pious air ‘you are probably aware mr copperfield that i am not altogether destitute of worldly possessions and that my daughter is my nearest and dearest relative’ i hurriedly made him a reply to the effect that i hoped the error into which i had been betrayed by the desperate nature of my love did not induce him to think me mercenary too ‘i do not allude to the matter in that light’ said mr spenlow ‘it would be better for yourself and all of us if you were mercenary mr copperfieldi mean if you were more discreet and less influenced by all this youthful nonsense no i merely say with quite another view you are probably aware i have some property to bequeath to my child’ i certainly supposed so ‘and you can hardly think’ said mr spenlow ‘having experience of what we see in the commons here every day of the various unaccountable and negligent proceedings of men in respect of their testamentary arrangementsof all subjects the one on which perhaps the strangest revelations of human inconsistency are to be met withbut that mine are made’ i inclined my head in acquiescence ‘i should not allow’ said mr spenlow with an evident increase of pious sentiment and slowly shaking his head as he poised himself upon his toes and heels alternately ‘my suitable provision for my child to be influenced by a piece of youthful folly like the present it is mere folly mere nonsense in a little while it will weigh lighter than any feather but i mighti mightif this silly business were not completely relinquished altogether be induced in some anxious moment to guard her from and surround her with protections against the consequences of any foolish step in the way of marriage now mr copperfield i hope that you will not render it necessary for me to open even for a quarter of an hour that closed page in the book of life and unsettle even for a quarter of an hour grave affairs long since composed’ there was a serenity a tranquillity a calm sunset air about him which quite affected me he was so peaceful and resignedclearly had his affairs in such perfect train and so systematically wound upthat he was a man to feel touched in the contemplation of i really think i saw tears rise to his eyes from the depth of his own feeling of all this but what could i do i could not deny dora and my own heart when he told me i had better take a week to consider of what he had said how could i say i would not take a week yet how could i fail to know that no amount of weeks could influence such love as mine ‘in the meantime confer with miss trotwood or with any person with any knowledge of life’ said mr spenlow adjusting his cravat with both hands ‘take a week mr copperfield’ i submitted and with a countenance as expressive as i was able to make it of dejected and despairing constancy came out of the room miss murdstone’s heavy eyebrows followed me to the doori say her eyebrows rather than her eyes because they were much more important in her faceand she looked so exactly as she used to look at about that hour of the morning in our parlour at blunderstone that i could have fancied i had been breaking down in my lessons again and that the dead weight on my mind was that horrible old spellingbook with oval woodcuts shaped to my youthful fancy like the glasses out of spectacles when i got to the office and shutting out old tiffey and the rest of them with my hands sat at my desk in my own particular nook thinking of this earthquake that had taken place so unexpectedly and in the bitterness of my spirit cursing jip i fell into such a state of torment about dora that i wonder i did not take up my hat and rush insanely to norwood the idea of their frightening her and making her cry and of my not being there to comfort her was so excruciating that it impelled me to write a wild letter to mr spenlow beseeching him not to visit upon her the consequences of my awful destiny i implored him to spare her gentle naturenot to crush a fragile flowerand addressed him generally to the best of my remembrance as if instead of being her father he had been an ogre or the dragon of wantley this letter i sealed and laid upon his desk before he returned and when he came in i saw him through the halfopened door of his room take it up and read it he said nothing about it all the morning but before he went away in the afternoon he called me in and told me that i need not make myself at all uneasy about his daughter’s happiness he had assured her he said that it was all nonsense and he had nothing more to say to her he believed he was an indulgent father as indeed he was and i might spare myself any solicitude on her account ‘you may make it necessary if you are foolish or obstinate mr copperfield’ he observed ‘for me to send my daughter abroad again for a term but i have a better opinion of you i hope you will be wiser than that in a few days as to miss murdstone’ for i had alluded to her in the letter ‘i respect that lady’s vigilance and feel obliged to her but she has strict charge to avoid the subject all i desire mr copperfield is that it should be forgotten all you have got to do mr copperfield is to forget it’ all in the note i wrote to miss mills i bitterly quoted this sentiment all i had to do i said with gloomy sarcasm was to forget dora that was all and what was that i entreated miss mills to see me that evening if it could not be done with mr mills’s sanction and concurrence i besought a clandestine interview in the back kitchen where the mangle was i informed her that my reason was tottering on its throne and only she miss mills could prevent its being deposed i signed myself hers distractedly and i could not help feeling while i read this composition over before sending it by a porter that it was something in the style of mr micawber however i sent it at night i repaired to miss mills’s street and walked up and down until i was stealthily fetched in by miss mills’s maid and taken the area way to the back kitchen i have since seen reason to believe that there was nothing on earth to prevent my going in at the front door and being shown up into the drawingroom except miss mills’s love of the romantic and mysterious in the back kitchen i raved as became me i went there i suppose to make a fool of myself and i am quite sure i did it miss mills had received a hasty note from dora telling her that all was discovered and saying ‘oh pray come to me julia do do’ but miss mills mistrusting the acceptability of her presence to the higher powers had not yet gone and we were all benighted in the desert of sahara miss mills had a wonderful flow of words and liked to pour them out i could not help feeling though she mingled her tears with mine that she had a dreadful luxury in our afflictions she petted them as i may say and made the most of them a deep gulf she observed had opened between dora and me and love could only span it with its rainbow love must suffer in this stern world it ever had been so it ever would be so no matter miss mills remarked hearts confined by cobwebs would burst at last and then love was avenged this was small consolation but miss mills would not encourage fallacious hopes she made me much more wretched than i was before and i felt and told her with the deepest gratitude that she was indeed a friend we resolved that she should go to dora the first thing in the morning and find some means of assuring her either by looks or words of my devotion and misery we parted overwhelmed with grief and i think miss mills enjoyed herself completely i confided all to my aunt when i got home and in spite of all she could say to me went to bed despairing i got up despairing and went out despairing it was saturday morning and i went straight to the commons i was surprised when i came within sight of our officedoor to see the ticketporters standing outside talking together and some halfdozen stragglers gazing at the windows which were shut up i quickened my pace and passing among them wondering at their looks went hurriedly in the clerks were there but nobody was doing anything old tiffey for the first time in his life i should think was sitting on somebody else’s stool and had not hung up his hat ‘this is a dreadful calamity mr copperfield’ said he as i entered ‘what is’ i exclaimed ‘what is the matter’ ‘do not you know’ cried tiffey and all the rest of them coming round me ‘no’ said i looking from face to face ‘mr spenlow’ said tiffey ‘what about him’ ‘dead’ i thought it was the office reeling and not i as one of the clerks caught hold of me they sat me down in a chair untied my neckcloth and brought me some water i have no idea whether this took any time ‘dead’ said i ‘he dined in town yesterday and drove down in the phaeton by himself’ said tiffey ‘having sent his own groom home by the coach as he sometimes did you know’ ‘well’ ‘the phaeton went home without him the horses stopped at the stablegate the man went out with a lantern nobody in the carriage’ ‘had they run away’ ‘they were not hot’ said tiffey putting on his glasses ‘no hotter i understand than they would have been going down at the usual pace the reins were broken but they had been dragging on the ground the house was roused up directly and three of them went out along the road they found him a mile off’ ‘more than a mile off mr tiffey’ interposed a junior ‘was it i believe you are right’ said tiffey‘more than a mile offnot far from the churchlying partly on the roadside and partly on the path upon his face whether he fell out in a fit or got out feeling ill before the fit came onor even whether he was quite dead then though there is no doubt he was quite insensibleno one appears to know if he breathed certainly he never spoke medical assistance was got as soon as possible but it was quite useless’ i cannot describe the state of mind into which i was thrown by this intelligence the shock of such an event happening so suddenly and happening to one with whom i had been in any respect at variancethe appalling vacancy in the room he had occupied so lately where his chair and table seemed to wait for him and his handwriting of yesterday was like a ghostthe indefinable impossibility of separating him from the place and feeling when the door opened as if he might come inthe lazy hush and rest there was in the office and the insatiable relish with which our people talked about it and other people came in and out all day and gorged themselves with the subjectthis is easily intelligible to anyone what i cannot describe is how in the innermost recesses of my own heart i had a lurking jealousy even of death how i felt as if its might would push me from my ground in dora’s thoughts how i was in a grudging way i have no words for envious of her grief how it made me restless to think of her weeping to others or being consoled by others how i had a grasping avaricious wish to shut out everybody from her but myself and to be all in all to her at that unseasonable time of all times in the trouble of this state of mindnot exclusively my own i hope but known to othersi went down to norwood that night and finding from one of the servants when i made my inquiries at the door that miss mills was there got my aunt to direct a letter to her which i wrote i deplored the untimely death of mr spenlow most sincerely and she would tears in doing so i entreated her to tell dora if dora were in a state to hear it that he had spoken to me with the utmost kindness and consideration and had coupled nothing but tenderness not a single or reproachful word with her name i know i did this selfishly to have my name brought before her but i tried to believe it was an act of justice to his memory perhaps i did believe it my aunt received a few lines next day in reply addressed outside to her within to me dora was overcome by grief and when her friend had asked her should she send her love to me had only cried as she was always crying ‘oh dear papa oh poor papa’ but she had not said no and that i made the most of mr jorkins who had been at norwood since the occurrence came to the office a few days afterwards he and tiffey were closeted together for some few moments and then tiffey looked out at the door and beckoned me in ‘oh’ said mr jorkins ‘mr tiffey and myself mr copperfield are about to examine the desks the drawers and other such repositories of the deceased with the view of sealing up his private papers and searching for a will there is no trace of any elsewhere it may be as well for you to assist us if you please’ i had been in agony to obtain some knowledge of the circumstances in which my dora would be placedas in whose guardianship and so forthand this was something towards it we began the search at once mr jorkins unlocking the drawers and desks and we all taking out the papers the officepapers we placed on one side and the private papers which were not numerous on the other we were very grave and when we came to a stray seal or pencilcase or ring or any little article of that kind which we associated personally with him we spoke very low we had sealed up several packets and were still going on dustily and quietly when mr jorkins said to us applying exactly the same words to his late partner as his late partner had applied to him ‘mr spenlow was very difficult to move from the beaten track you know what he was i am disposed to think he had made no will’ ‘oh i know he had’ said i they both stopped and looked at me ‘on the very day when i last saw him’ said i ‘he told me that he had and that his affairs were long since settled’ mr jorkins and old tiffey shook their heads with one accord ‘that looks unpromising’ said tiffey ‘very unpromising’ said mr jorkins ‘surely you do not doubt’ i began ‘my good mr copperfield’ said tiffey laying his hand upon my arm and shutting up both his eyes as he shook his head ‘if you had been in the commons as long as i have you would know that there is no subject on which men are so inconsistent and so little to be trusted’ ‘why bless my soul he made that very remark’ i replied persistently ‘i should call that almost final’ observed tiffey ‘my opinion isno will’ it appeared a wonderful thing to me but it turned out that there was no will he had never so much as thought of making one so far as his papers afforded any evidence for there was no kind of hint sketch or memorandum of any testamentary intention whatever what was scarcely less astonishing to me was that his affairs were in a most disordered state it was extremely difficult i heard to make out what he owed or what he had paid or of what he died possessed it was considered likely that for years he could have had no clear opinion on these subjects himself by little and little it came out that in the competition on all points of appearance and gentility then running high in the commons he had spent more than his professional income which was not a very large one and had reduced his private means if they ever had been great which was exceedingly doubtful to a very low ebb indeed there was a sale of the furniture and lease at norwood and tiffey told me little thinking how interested i was in the story that paying all the just debts of the deceased and deducting his share of outstanding bad and doubtful debts due to the firm he would not give a thousand pounds for all the assets remaining this was at the expiration of about six weeks i had suffered tortures all the time and thought i really must have laid violent hands upon myself when miss mills still reported to me that my brokenhearted little dora would say nothing when i was mentioned but ‘oh poor papa oh dear papa’ also that she had no other relations than two aunts maiden sisters of mr spenlow who lived at putney and who had not held any other than chance communication with their brother for many years not that they had ever quarrelled miss mills informed me but that having been on the occasion of dora’s christening invited to tea when they considered themselves privileged to be invited to dinner they had expressed their opinion in writing that it was ‘better for the happiness of all parties’ that they should stay away since which they had gone their road and their brother had gone his these two ladies now emerged from their retirement and proposed to take dora to live at putney dora clinging to them both and weeping exclaimed ‘o yes aunts please take julia mills and me and jip to putney’ so they went very soon after the funeral how i found time to haunt putney i am sure i do not know but i contrived by some means or other to prowl about the neighbourhood pretty often miss mills for the more exact discharge of the duties of friendship kept a journal and she used to meet me sometimes on the common and read it or if she had not time to do that lend it to me how i treasured up the entries of which i subjoin a sample ‘monday my sweet d still much depressed headache called attention to j as being beautifully sleek d fondled j associations thus awakened opened

palace of cards which had tumbled down leaving only miss mills and me among the ruins i felt as if some grim enchanter had drawn a magic circle round the innocent goddess of my heart which nothing indeed but those same strong pinions capable of carrying so many people over so much would enable me to enter
