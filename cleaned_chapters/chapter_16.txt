i am a new boy in more senses than one next morning after breakfast i entered on school life again i went accompanied by mr wickfield to the scene of my future studiesa grave building in a courtyard with a learned air about it that seemed very well suited to the stray rooks and jackdaws who came down from the cathedral towers to walk with a clerkly bearing on the grassplotand was introduced to my new master doctor strong doctor strong looked almost as rusty to my thinking as the tall iron rails and gates outside the house and almost as stiff and heavy as the great stone urns that flanked them and were set up on the top of the redbrick wall at regular distances all round the court like sublimated skittles for time to play at he was in his library i mean doctor strong was with his clothes not particularly well brushed and his hair not particularly well combed his kneesmalls unbraced his long black gaiters unbuttoned and his shoes yawning like two caverns on the hearthrug turning upon me a lustreless eye that reminded me of a longforgotten blind old horse who once used to crop the grass and tumble over the graves in blunderstone churchyard he said he was glad to see me and then he gave me his hand which i did not know what to do with as it did nothing for itself but sitting at work not far from doctor strong was a very pretty young ladywhom he called annie and who was his daughter i supposedwho got me out of my difficulty by kneeling down to put doctor strong’s shoes on and button his gaiters which she did with great cheerfulness and quickness when she had finished and we were going out to the schoolroom i was much surprised to hear mr wickfield in bidding her good morning address her as ‘mrs strong’ and i was wondering could she be doctor strong’s son’s wife or could she be mrs doctor strong when doctor strong himself unconsciously enlightened me ‘by the by wickfield’ he said stopping in a passage with his hand on my shoulder ‘you have not found any suitable provision for my wife’s cousin yet’ ‘no’ said mr wickfield ‘no not yet’ ‘i could wish it done as soon as it can be done wickfield’ said doctor strong ‘for jack maldon is needy and idle and of those two bad things worse things sometimes come what does doctor watts say’ he added looking at me and moving his head to the time of his quotation ‘“satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do”’ ‘egad doctor’ returned mr wickfield ‘if doctor watts knew mankind he might have written with as much truth “satan finds some mischief still for busy hands to do” the busy people achieve their full share of mischief in the world you may rely upon it what have the people been about who have been the busiest in getting money and in getting power this century or two no mischief’ ‘jack maldon will never be very busy in getting either i expect’ said doctor strong rubbing his chin thoughtfully ‘perhaps not’ said mr wickfield ‘and you bring me back to the question with an apology for digressing no i have not been able to dispose of mr jack maldon yet i believe’ he said this with some hesitation ‘i penetrate your motive and it makes the thing more difficult’ ‘my motive’ returned doctor strong ‘is to make some suitable provision for a cousin and an old playfellow of annie’s’ ‘yes i know’ said mr wickfield ‘at home or abroad’ ‘aye’ replied the doctor apparently wondering why he emphasized those words so much ‘at home or abroad’ ‘your own expression you know’ said mr wickfield ‘or abroad’ ‘surely’ the doctor answered ‘surely one or other’ ‘one or other have you no choice’ asked mr wickfield ‘no’ returned the doctor ‘no’ with astonishment ‘not the least’ ‘no motive’ said mr wickfield ‘for meaning abroad and not at home’ ‘no’ returned the doctor ‘i am bound to believe you and of course i do believe you’ said mr wickfield ‘it might have simplified my office very much if i had known it before but i confess i entertained another impression’ doctor strong regarded him with a puzzled and doubting look which almost immediately subsided into a smile that gave me great encouragement for it was full of amiability and sweetness and there was a simplicity in it and indeed in his whole manner when the studious pondering frost upon it was got through very attractive and hopeful to a young scholar like me repeating ‘no’ and ‘not the least’ and other short assurances to the same purport doctor strong jogged on before us at a queer uneven pace and we followed mr wickfield looking grave i observed and shaking his head to himself without knowing that i saw him the schoolroom was a pretty large hall on the quietest side of the house confronted by the stately stare of some halfdozen of the great urns and commanding a peep of an old secluded garden belonging to the doctor where the peaches were ripening on the sunny south wall there were two great aloes in tubs on the turf outside the windows the broad hard leaves of which plant looking as if they were made of painted tin have ever since by association been symbolical to me of silence and retirement about fiveandtwenty boys were studiously engaged at their books when we went in but they rose to give the doctor good morning and remained standing when they saw mr wickfield and me ‘a new boy young gentlemen’ said the doctor ‘trotwood copperfield’ one adams who was the headboy then stepped out of his place and welcomed me he looked like a young clergyman in his white cravat but he was very affable and goodhumoured and he showed me my place and presented me to the masters in a gentlemanly way that would have put me at my ease if anything could it seemed to me so long however since i had been among such boys or among any companions of my own age except mick walker and mealy potatoes that i felt as strange as ever i have done in my life i was so conscious of having passed through scenes of which they could have no knowledge and of having acquired experiences foreign to my age appearance and condition as one of them that i half believed it was an imposture to come there as an ordinary little schoolboy i had become in the murdstone and grinby time however short or long it may have been so unused to the sports and games of boys that i knew i was awkward and inexperienced in the commonest things belonging to them whatever i had learnt had so slipped away from me in the sordid cares of my life from day to night that now when i was examined about what i knew i knew nothing and was put into the lowest form of the school but troubled as i was by my want of boyish skill and of booklearning too i was made infinitely more uncomfortable by the consideration that in what i did know i was much farther removed from my companions than in what i did not my mind ran upon what they would think if they knew of my familiar acquaintance with the king’s bench prison was there anything about me which would reveal my proceedings in connexion with the micawber familyall those pawnings and sellings and suppersin spite of myself suppose some of the boys had seen me coming through canterbury wayworn and ragged and should find me out what would they say who made so light of money if they could know how i had scraped my halfpence together for the purchase of my daily saveloy and beer or my slices of pudding how would it affect them who were so innocent of london life and london streets to discover how knowing i was and was ashamed to be in some of the meanest phases of both all this ran in my head so much on that first day at doctor strong’s that i felt distrustful of my slightest look and gesture shrunk within myself whensoever i was approached by one of my new schoolfellows and hurried off the minute school was over afraid of committing myself in my response to any friendly notice or advance but there was such an influence in mr wickfield’s old house that when i knocked at it with my new schoolbooks under my arm i began to feel my uneasiness softening away as i went up to my airy old room the grave shadow of the staircase seemed to fall upon my doubts and fears and to make the past more indistinct i sat there sturdily conning my books until dinnertime we were out of school for good at three and went down hopeful of becoming a passable sort of boy yet agnes was in the drawingroom waiting for her father who was detained by someone in his office she met me with her pleasant smile and asked me how i liked the school i told her i should like it very much i hoped but i was a little strange to it at first ‘you have never been to school’ i said ‘have you’ ‘oh yes every day’ ‘ah but you mean here at your own home’ ‘papa could not spare me to go anywhere else’ she answered smiling and shaking her head ‘his housekeeper must be in his house you know’ ‘he is very fond of you i am sure’ i said she nodded ‘yes’ and went to the door to listen for his coming up that she might meet him on the stairs but as he was not there she came back again ‘mama has been dead ever since i was born’ she said in her quiet way ‘i only know her picture downstairs i saw you looking at it yesterday did you think whose it was’ i told her yes because it was so like herself ‘papa says so too’ said agnes pleased ‘hark that is papa now’ her bright calm face lighted up with pleasure as she went to meet him and as they came in hand in hand he greeted me cordially and told me i should certainly be happy under doctor strong who was one of the gentlest of men ‘there may be some perhapsi do not know that there arewho abuse his kindness’ said mr wickfield ‘never be one of those trotwood in anything he is the least suspicious of mankind and whether that is a merit or whether it is a blemish it deserves consideration in all dealings with the doctor great or small’ he spoke i thought as if he were weary or dissatisfied with something but i did not pursue the question in my mind for dinner was just then announced and we went down and took the same seats as before we had scarcely done so when uriah heep put in his red head and his lank hand at the door and said ‘here is mr maldon begs the favour of a word sir’ ‘i am but this moment quit of mr maldon’ said his master ‘yes sir’ returned uriah ‘but mr maldon has come back and he begs the favour of a word’ as he held the door open with his hand uriah looked at me and looked at agnes and looked at the dishes and looked at the plates and looked at every object in the room i thoughtyet seemed to look at nothing he made such an appearance all the while of keeping his red eyes dutifully on his master ‘i beg your pardon it is only to say on reflection’ observed a voice behind uriah as uriah’s head was pushed away and the speaker’s substituted‘pray excuse me for this intrusionthat as it seems i have no choice in the matter the sooner i go abroad the better my cousin annie did say when we talked of it that she liked to have her friends within reach rather than to have them banished and the old doctor’ ‘doctor strong was that’ mr wickfield interposed gravely ‘doctor strong of course’ returned the other ‘i call him the old doctor it is all the same you know’ ‘i do not know’ returned mr wickfield ‘well doctor strong’ said the other‘doctor strong was of the same mind i believed but as it appears from the course you take with me he has changed his mind why there is no more to be said except that the sooner i am off the better therefore i thought i would come back and say that the sooner i am off the better when a plunge is to be made into the water it is of no use lingering on the bank’ ‘there shall be as little lingering as possible in your case mr maldon you may depend upon it’ said mr wickfield ‘thank’ee’ said the other ‘much obliged i do not want to look a gifthorse in the mouth which is not a gracious thing to do otherwise i dare say my cousin annie could easily arrange it in her own way i suppose annie would only have to say to the old doctor’ ‘meaning that mrs strong would only have to say to her husbanddo i follow you’ said mr wickfield ‘quite so’ returned the other ‘would only have to say that she wanted such and such a thing to be so and so and it would be so and so as a matter of course’ ‘and why as a matter of course mr maldon’ asked mr wickfield sedately eating his dinner ‘why because annie’s a charming young girl and the old doctordoctor strong i meanis not quite a charming young boy’ said mr jack maldon laughing ‘no offence to anybody mr wickfield i only mean that i suppose some compensation is fair and reasonable in that sort of marriage’ ‘compensation to the lady sir’ asked mr wickfield gravely ‘to the lady sir’ mr jack maldon answered laughing but appearing to remark that mr wickfield went on with his dinner in the same sedate immovable manner and that there was no hope of making him relax a muscle of his face he added ‘however i have said what i came to say and with another apology for this intrusion i may take myself off of course i shall observe your directions in considering the matter as one to be arranged between you and me solely and not to be referred to up at the doctor’s’ ‘have you dined’ asked mr wickfield with a motion of his hand towards the table ‘thank’ee i am going to dine’ said mr maldon ‘with my cousin annie goodbye’ mr wickfield without rising looked after him thoughtfully as he went out he was rather a shallow sort of young gentleman i thought with a handsome face a rapid utterance and a confident bold air and this was the first i ever saw of mr jack maldon whom i had not expected to see so soon when i heard the doctor speak of him that morning when we had dined we went upstairs again where everything went on exactly as on the previous day agnes set the glasses and decanters in the same corner and mr wickfield sat down to drink and drank a good deal agnes played the piano to him sat by him and worked and talked and played some games at dominoes with me in good time she made tea and afterwards when i brought down my books looked into them and showed me what she knew of them which was no slight matter though she said it was and what was the best way to learn and understand them i see her with her modest orderly placid manner and i hear her beautiful calm voice as i write these words the influence for all good which she came to exercise over me at a later time begins already to descend upon my breast i love little them’ly and i do not love agnesno not at all in that waybut i feel that there are goodness peace and truth wherever agnes is and that the soft light of the coloured window in the church seen long ago falls on her always and on me when i am near her and on everything around the time having come for her withdrawal for the night and she having left us i gave mr wickfield my hand preparatory to going away myself but he checked me and said ‘should you like to stay with us trotwood or to go elsewhere’ ‘to stay’ i answered quickly ‘you are sure’ ‘if you please if i may’ ‘why it is but a dull life that we lead here boy i am afraid’ he said ‘not more dull for me than agnes sir not dull at all’ ‘than agnes’ he repeated walking slowly to the great chimneypiece and leaning against it ‘than agnes’ he had drank wine that evening or i fancied it until his eyes were bloodshot not that i could see them now for they were cast down and shaded by his hand but i had noticed them a little while before ‘now i wonder’ he muttered ‘whether my agnes tires of me when should i ever tire of her but that is different that is quite different’ he was musing not speaking to me so i remained quiet ‘a dull old house’ he said ‘and a monotonous life but i must have her near me i must keep her near me if the thought that i may die and leave my darling or that my darling may die and leave me comes like a spectre to distress my happiest hours and is only to be drowned in’ he did not supply the word but pacing slowly to the place where he had sat and mechanically going through the action of pouring wine from the empty decanter set it down and paced back again ‘if it is miserable to bear when she is here’ he said ‘what would it be and she away no no no i cannot try that’ he leaned against the chimneypiece brooding so long that i could not decide whether to run the risk of disturbing him by going or to remain quietly where i was until he should come out of his reverie at length he aroused himself and looked about the room until his eyes encountered mine ‘stay with us trotwood eh’ he said in his usual manner and as if he were answering something i had just said ‘i am glad of it you are company to us both it is wholesome to have you here wholesome for me wholesome for agnes wholesome perhaps for all of us’ ‘i am sure it is for me sir’ i said ‘i am so glad to be here’ ‘that is a fine fellow’ said mr wickfield ‘as long as you are glad to be here you shall stay here’ he shook hands with me upon it and clapped me on the back and told me that when i had anything to do at night after agnes had left us or when i wished to read for my own pleasure i was free to come down to his room if he were there and if i desired it for company’s sake and to sit with him i thanked him for his consideration and as he went down soon afterwards and i was not tired went down too with a book in my hand to avail myself for halfanhour of his permission but seeing a light in the little round office and immediately feeling myself attracted towards uriah heep who had a sort of fascination for me i went in there instead i found uriah reading a great fat book with such demonstrative attention that his lank forefinger followed up every line as he read and made clammy tracks along the page or so i fully believed like a snail ‘you are working late tonight uriah’ says i ‘yes master copperfield’ says uriah as i was getting on the stool opposite to talk to him more conveniently i observed that he had not such a thing as a smile about him and that he could only widen his mouth and make two hard creases down his cheeks one on each side to stand for one ‘i am not doing officework master copperfield’ said uriah ‘what work then’ i asked ‘i am improving my legal knowledge master copperfield’ said uriah ‘i am going through tidd’s practice oh what a writer mr tidd is master copperfield’ my stool was such a tower of observation that as i watched him reading on again after this rapturous exclamation and following up the lines with his forefinger i observed that his nostrils which were thin and pointed with sharp dints in them had a singular and most uncomfortable way of expanding and contracting themselvesthat they seemed to twinkle instead of his eyes which hardly ever twinkled at all ‘i suppose you are quite a great lawyer’ i said after looking at him for some time ‘me master copperfield’ said uriah ‘oh no i am a very umble person’ it was no fancy of mine about his hands i observed for he frequently ground the palms against each other as if to squeeze them dry and warm besides often wiping them in a stealthy way on his pockethandkerchief ‘i am well aware that i am the umblest person going’ said uriah heep modestly ‘let the other be where he may my mother is likewise a very umble person we live in a numble abode master copperfield but have much to be thankful for my father’s former calling was umble he was a sexton’ ‘what is he now’ i asked ‘he is a partaker of glory at present master copperfield’ said uriah heep ‘but we have much to be thankful for how much have i to be thankful for in living with mr wickfield’ i asked uriah if he had been with mr wickfield long ‘i have been with him going on four year master copperfield’ said uriah shutting up his book after carefully marking the place where he had left off ‘since a year after my father’s death how much have i to be thankful for in that how much have i to be thankful for in mr wickfield’s kind intention to give me my articles which would otherwise not lay within the umble means of mother and self’ ‘then when your articled time is over you will be a regular lawyer i suppose’ said i ‘with the blessing of providence master copperfield’ returned uriah ‘perhaps you will be a partner in mr wickfield’s business one of these days’ i said to make myself agreeable ‘and it will be wickfield and heep or heep late wickfield’ ‘oh no master copperfield’ returned uriah shaking his head ‘i am much too umble for that’ he certainly did look uncommonly like the carved face on the beam outside my window as he sat in his humility eyeing me sideways with his mouth widened and the creases in his cheeks ‘mr wickfield is a most excellent man master copperfield’ said uriah ‘if you have known him long you know it i am sure much better than i can inform you’ i replied that i was certain he was but that i had not known him long myself though he was a friend of my aunt’s ‘oh indeed master copperfield’ said uriah ‘your aunt is a sweet lady master copperfield’ he had a way of writhing when he wanted to express enthusiasm which was very ugly and which diverted my attention from the compliment he had paid my relation to the snaky twistings of his throat and body ‘a sweet lady master copperfield’ said uriah heep ‘she has a great admiration for miss agnes master copperfield i believe’ i said ‘yes’ boldly not that i knew anything about it heaven forgive me ‘i hope you have too master copperfield’ said uriah ‘but i am sure you must have’ ‘everybody must have’ i returned ‘oh thank you master copperfield’ said uriah heep ‘for that remark it is so true umble as i am i know it is so true oh thank you master copperfield’ he writhed himself quite off his stool in the excitement of his feelings and being off began to make arrangements for going home ‘mother will be expecting me’ he said referring to a pale inexpressivefaced watch in his pocket ‘and getting uneasy for though we are very umble master copperfield we are much attached to one another if you would come and see us any afternoon and take a cup of tea at our lowly dwelling mother would be as proud of your company as i should be’ i said i should be glad to come ‘thank you master copperfield’ returned uriah putting his book away upon the shelf‘i suppose you stop here some time master copperfield’ i said i was going to be brought up there i believed as long as i remained at school ‘oh indeed’ exclaimed uriah ‘i should think you would come into the business at last master copperfield’ i protested that i had no views of that sort and that no such scheme was entertained in my behalf by anybody but uriah insisted on blandly replying to all my assurances ‘oh yes master copperfield i should think you would indeed’ and ‘oh indeed master copperfield i should think you would certainly’ over and over again being at last ready to leave the office for the night he asked me if it would suit my convenience to have the light put out and on my answering ‘yes’ instantly extinguished it after shaking hands with mehis hand felt like a fish in the darkhe opened the door into the street a very little and crept out and shut it leaving me to grope my way back into the house which cost me some trouble and a fall over his stool this was the proximate because i suppose of my dreaming about him for what appeared to me to be half the night and dreaming among other things that he had launched mr peggotty’s house on a piratical expedition with a black flag at the masthead bearing the inscription ‘tidd’s practice’ under which diabolical ensign he was carrying me and little them’ly to the spanish main to be drowned i got a little the better of my uneasiness when i went to school next day and a good deal the better next day and so shook it off by degrees that in less than a fortnight i was quite at home and happy among my new companions i was awkward enough in their games and backward enough in their studies but custom would improve me in the first respect i hoped and hard work in the second accordingly i went to work very hard both in play and in earnest and gained great commendation and in a very little while the murdstone and grinby life became so strange to me that i hardly believed in it while my present life grew so familiar that i seemed to have been leading it a long time doctor strong’s was an excellent school as different from mr creakle’s as good is from evil it was very gravely and decorously ordered and on a sound system with an appeal in everything to the honour and good faith of the boys and an avowed intention to rely on their possession of those qualities unless they proved themselves unworthy of it which worked wonders we all felt that we had a part in the management of the place and in sustaining its character and dignity hence we soon became warmly attached to iti am sure i did for one and i never knew in all my time of any other boy being otherwiseand learnt with a good will desiring to do it credit we had noble games out of hours and plenty of liberty but even then as i remember we were well spoken of in the town and rarely did any disgrace by our appearance or manner to the reputation of doctor strong and doctor strong’s boys some of the higher scholars boarded in the doctor’s house and through them i learned at second hand some particulars of the doctor’s historyas how he had not yet been married twelve months to the beautiful young lady i had seen in the study whom he had married for love for she had not a sixpence and had a world of poor relations so our fellows said ready to swarm the doctor out of house and home also how the doctor’s cogitating manner was attributable to his being always engaged in looking out for greek roots which in my innocence and ignorance i supposed to be a botanical furor on the doctor’s part especially as he always looked at the ground when he walked about until i understood that they were roots of words with a view to a new dictionary which he had in contemplation adams our headboy who had a turn for mathematics had made a calculation i was informed of the time this dictionary would take in completing on the doctor’s plan and at the doctor’s rate of going he considered that it might be done in one thousand six hundred and fortynine years counting from the doctor’s last or sixtysecond birthday but the doctor himself was the idol of the whole school and it must have been a badly composed school if he had been anything else for he was the kindest of men with a simple faith in him that might have touched the stone hearts of the very urns upon the wall as he walked up and down that part of the courtyard which was at the side of the house with the stray rooks and jackdaws looking after him with their heads cocked slyly as if they knew how much more knowing they were in worldly affairs than he if any sort of vagabond could only get near enough to his creaking shoes to attract his attention to one sentence of a tale of distress that vagabond was made for the next two days it was so notorious in the house that the masters and headboys took pains to cut these marauders off at angles and to get out of windows and turn them out of the courtyard before they could make the doctor aware of their presence which was sometimes happily effected within a few yards of him without his knowing anything of the matter as he jogged to and fro outside his own domain and unprotected he was a very sheep for the shearers he would have taken his gaiters off his legs to give away in fact there was a story current among us i have no idea and never had on what authority but i have believed it for so many years that i feel quite certain it is true that on a frosty day one wintertime he actually did bestow his gaiters on a beggarwoman who occasioned some scandal in the neighbourhood by exhibiting a fine infant from door to door wrapped in those garments which were universally recognized being as well known in the vicinity as the cathedral the legend added that the only person who did not identify them was the doctor himself who when they were shortly afterwards displayed at the door of a little secondhand shop of no very good repute where such things were taken in exchange for gin was more than once observed to handle them approvingly as if admiring some curious novelty in the pattern and considering them an improvement on his own it was very pleasant to see the doctor with his pretty young wife he had a fatherly benignant way of showing his fondness for her which seemed in itself to express a good man i often saw them walking in the garden where the peaches were and i sometimes had a nearer observation of them in the study or the parlour she appeared to me to take great care of the doctor and to like him very much though i never thought her vitally interested in the dictionary some cumbrous fragments of which work the doctor always carried in his pockets and in the lining of his hat and generally seemed to be expounding to her as they walked about i saw a good deal of mrs strong both because she had taken a liking for me on the morning of my introduction to the doctor and was always afterwards kind to me and interested in me and because she was very fond of agnes and was often backwards and forwards at our house there was a curious constraint between her and mr wickfield i thought of whom she seemed to be afraid that never wore off when she came there of an evening she always shrunk from accepting his escort home and ran away with me instead and sometimes as we were running gaily across the cathedral yard together expecting to meet nobody we would meet mr jack maldon who was always surprised to see us mrs strong’s mama was a lady i took great delight in her name was mrs markleham but our boys used to call her the old soldier on account of her generalship and the skill with which she marshalled great forces of relations against the doctor she was a little sharpeyed woman who used to wear when she was dressed one unchangeable cap ornamented with some artificial flowers and two artificial butterflies supposed to be hovering above the flowers there was a superstition among us that this cap had come from france and could only originate in the workmanship of that ingenious nation but all i certainly know about it is that it always made its appearance of an evening wheresoever mrs markleham made her appearance that it was carried about to friendly meetings in a hindoo basket that the butterflies had the gift of trembling constantly and that they improved the shining hours at doctor strong’s expense like busy bees i observed the old soldiernot to adopt the name disrespectfullyto pretty good advantage on a night which is made memorable to me by something else i shall relate it was the night of a little party at the doctor’s which was given on the occasion of mr jack maldon’s departure for india whither he was going as a cadet or something of that kind mr wickfield having at length arranged the business it happened to be the doctor’s birthday too we had had a holiday had made presents to him in the morning had made a speech to him through the headboy and had cheered him until we were hoarse and until he had she would tears and now in the evening mr wickfield agnes and i went to have tea with him in his private capacity mr jack maldon was there before us mrs strong dressed in white with cherrycoloured ribbons was playing the piano when we went in and he was leaning over her to turn the leaves the clear red and white of her complexion was not so blooming and flowerlike as usual i thought when she turned round but she looked very pretty wonderfully pretty ‘i have forgotten doctor’ said mrs strong’s mama when we were seated ‘to pay you the compliments of the daythough they are as you may suppose very far from being mere compliments in my case allow me to wish you many happy returns’ ‘i thank you madam’ replied the doctor ‘many many many happy returns’ said the old soldier ‘not only for your own sake but for annie’s and john maldon’s and many other people’s it seems but yesterday to me john when you were a little creature a head shorter than master copperfield making baby love to annie behind the gooseberry bushes in the backgarden’ ‘my dear mama’ said mrs strong ‘never mind that now’ ‘annie do not be absurd’ returned her mother ‘if you are to blush to hear of such things now you are an old married woman when are you not to blush to hear of them’ ‘old’ exclaimed mr jack maldon ‘annie come’ ‘yes john’ returned the soldier ‘virtually an old married woman although not old by yearsfor when did you ever hear me say or who has ever heard me say that a girl of twenty was old by yearsyour cousin is the wife of the doctor and as such what i have described her it is well for you john that your cousin is the wife of the doctor you have found in him an influential and kind friend who will be kinder yet i venture to predict if you deserve it i have no false pride i never hesitate to admit frankly that there are some members of our family who want a friend you were one yourself before your cousin’s influence raised up one for you’ the doctor in the goodness of his heart waved his hand as if to make light of it and save mr jack maldon from any further reminder but mrs markleham changed her chair for one next the doctor’s and putting her fan on his coatsleeve said ‘no really my dear doctor you must excuse me if i appear to dwell on this rather because i feel so very strongly i call it quite my monomania it is such a subject of mine you are a blessing to us you really are a boon you know’ ‘nonsense nonsense’ said the doctor ‘no no i beg your pardon’ retorted the old soldier ‘with nobody present but our dear and confidential friend mr wickfield i cannot consent to be put down i shall begin to assert the privileges of a motherinlaw if you go on like that and scold you i am perfectly honest and outspoken what i am saying is what i said when you first overpowered me with surpriseyou remember how surprised i wasby proposing for annie not that there was anything so very much out of the way in the mere fact of the proposalit would be ridiculous to say thatbut because you having known her poor father and having known her from a baby six months old i had not thought of you in such a light at all or indeed as a marrying man in any waysimply that you know’ ‘aye aye’ returned the doctor goodhumouredly ‘never mind’ ‘but i do mind’ said the old soldier laying her fan upon his lips ‘i mind very much i recall these things that i may be contradicted if i am wrong well then i spoke to annie and i told her what had happened i said “my dear here is doctor strong has positively been and made you the subject of a handsome declaration and an offer” did i press it in the least no i said “now annie tell me the truth this moment is your heart free” “mama” she said crying “i am extremely young”which was perfectly true“and i hardly know if i have a heart at all” “then my dear” i said “you may rely upon it it is free at all events my love” said i “doctor strong is in an agitated state of mind and must be answered he cannot be kept in his present state of suspense” “mama” said annie still crying “would he be unhappy without me if he would i honour and respect him so much that i think i will have him” so it was settled and then and not till then i said to annie “annie doctor strong will not only be your husband but he will represent your late father he will represent the head of our family he will represent the wisdom and station and i may say the means of our family and will be in short a boon to it” i used the word at the time and i have used it again today if i have any merit it is consistency’ the daughter had sat quite silent and still during this speech with her eyes fixed on the ground her cousin standing near her and looking on the ground too she now said very softly in a trembling voice ‘mama i hope you have finished’ ‘no my dear annie’ returned the old soldier ‘i have not quite finished since you ask me my love i reply that i have not i complain that you really are a little unnatural towards your own family and as it is of no use complaining to you i mean to complain to your husband now my dear doctor do look at that silly wife of yours’ as the doctor turned his kind face with its smile of simplicity and gentleness towards her she drooped her head more i noticed that mr wickfield looked at her steadily ‘when i happened to say to that naughty thing the other day’ pursued her mother shaking her head and her fan at her playfully ‘that there was a family circumstance she might mention to youindeed i think was bound to mentionshe said that to mention it was to ask a favour and that as you were too generous and as for her to ask was always to have she would not’ ‘annie my dear’ said the doctor ‘that was wrong it robbed me of a pleasure’ ‘almost the very words i said to her’ exclaimed her mother ‘now really another time when i know what she would tell you but for this reason and will not i have a great mind my dear doctor to tell you myself’ ‘i shall be glad if you will’ returned the doctor ‘shall i’ ‘certainly’ ‘well then i will’ said the old soldier ‘that is a bargain’ and having i suppose carried her point she tapped the doctor’s hand several times with her fan which she kissed first and returned triumphantly to her former station some more company coming in among whom were the two masters and adams the talk became general and it naturally turned on mr jack maldon and his voyage and the country he was going to and his various plans and prospects he was to leave that night after supper in a postchaise for gravesend where the ship in which he was to make the voyage lay and was to be goneunless he came home on leave or for his healthi do not know how many years i recollect it was settled by general consent that india was quite a misrepresented country and had nothing objectionable in it but a tiger or two and a little heat in the warm part of the day for my own part i looked on mr jack maldon as a modern sindbad and pictured him the bosom friend of all the rajahs in the east sitting under canopies smoking curly golden pipesa mile long if they could be straightened out mrs strong was a very pretty singer as i knew who often heard her singing by herself but whether she was afraid of singing before people or was out of voice that evening it was certain that she could not sing at all she tried a duet once with her cousin maldon but could not so much as begin and afterwards when she tried to sing by herself although she began sweetly her voice died away on a sudden and left her quite distressed with her head hanging down over the keys the good doctor said she was nervous and to relieve her proposed a round game at cards of which he knew as much as of the art of playing the trombone but i remarked that the old soldier took him into custody directly for her partner and instructed him as the first preliminary of initiation to give her all the silver he had in his pocket we had a merry game not made the less merry by the doctor’s mistakes of which he committed an innumerable quantity in spite of the watchfulness of the butterflies and to their great aggravation mrs strong had declined to play on the ground of not feeling very well and her cousin maldon had excused himself because he had some packing to do when he had done it however he returned and they sat together talking on the sofa from time to time she came and looked over the doctor’s hand and told him what to play she was very pale as she bent over him and i thought her finger trembled as she pointed out the cards but the doctor was quite happy in her attention and took no notice of this if it were so at supper we were hardly so gay everyone appeared to feel that a parting of that sort was an awkward thing and that the nearer it approached the more awkward it was mr jack maldon tried to be very talkative but was not at his ease and made matters worse and they were not improved as it appeared to me by the old soldier who continually recalled passages of mr jack maldon’s youth the doctor however who felt i am sure that he was making everybody happy was well pleased and had no suspicion but that we were all at the utmost height of enjoyment ‘annie my dear’ said he looking at his watch and filling his glass ‘it is past your cousin jack’s time and we must not detain him since time and tideboth concerned in this casewait for no man mr jack maldon you have a long voyage and a strange country before you but many men have had both and many men will have both to the end of time the winds you are going to tempt have wafted thousands upon thousands to fortune and brought thousands upon thousands happily back’ ‘it is an affecting thing’ said mrs markleham‘however it is viewed it is affecting to see a fine young man one has known from an infant going away to the other end of the world leaving all he knows behind and not knowing what is before him a young man really well deserves constant support and patronage’ looking at the doctor ‘who makes such sacrifices’ ‘time will go fast with you mr jack maldon’ pursued the doctor ‘and fast with all of us some of us can hardly expect perhaps in the natural course of things to greet you on your return the next best thing is to hope to do it and that is my case i shall not weary you with good advice you have long had a good model before you in your cousin annie imitate her virtues as nearly as you can’ mrs markleham fanned herself and shook her head ‘farewell mr jack’ said the doctor standing up on which we all stood up ‘a prosperous voyage out a thriving career abroad and a happy return home’ we all drank the toast and all shook hands with mr jack maldon after which he hastily took leave of the ladies who were there and hurried to the door where he was received as he got into the chaise with a tremendous broadside of cheers discharged by our boys who had assembled on the lawn for the purpose running in among them to swell the ranks i was very near the chaise when it rolled away and i had a lively impression made upon me in the midst of the noise and dust of having seen mr jack maldon rattle past with an agitated face and something cherrycoloured in his hand after another broadside for the doctor and another for the doctor’s wife the boys dispersed and i went back into the house where i found the guests all standing in a group about the doctor discussing how mr jack maldon had gone away and how he had borne it and how he had felt it and all the rest of it in the midst of these remarks mrs markleham cried ‘where is annie’ no annie was there and when they called to her no annie replied but all pressing out of the room in a crowd to see what was the matter we found her lying on the hall floor there was great alarm at first until it was found that she was in a swoon and that the swoon was yielding to the usual means of recovery when the doctor who had lifted her head upon his knee put her curls aside with his hand and said looking around ‘poor annie she is so faithful and tenderhearted it is the parting from her old playfellow and friendher favourite cousinthat has done this ah it is a pity i am very sorry’ when she opened her eyes and saw where she was and that we were all standing about her she arose with assistance turning her head as she did so to lay it on the doctor’s shoulderor to hide it i do not know which we went into the drawingroom to leave her with the doctor and her mother but she said it seemed that she was better than she had been since morning and that she would rather be brought among us so they brought her in looking very white and weak i thought and sat her on a sofa ‘annie my dear’ said her mother doing something to her dress ‘see here you have lost a bow will anybody be so good as find a ribbon a cherrycoloured ribbon’ it was the one she had worn at her bosom we all looked for it i myself looked everywhere i am certainbut nobody could find it ‘do you recollect where you had it last annie’ said her mother i wondered how i could have thought she looked white or anything but burning red when she answered that she had had it safe a little while ago she thought but it was not worth looking for nevertheless it was looked for again and still not found she entreated that there might be no more searching but it was still sought for in a desultory way until she was quite well and the company took their departure we walked very slowly home mr wickfield agnes and iagnes and i admiring the moonlight and mr wickfield scarcely raising his eyes from the ground when we at last reached our own door agnes discovered that she had left her little reticule behind delighted to be of any service to her i ran back to fetch it i went into the supperroom where it had been left which was deserted and dark but a door of communication between that and the doctor’s study where there was a light being open i passed on there to say what i wanted and to get a candle the doctor was sitting in his easychair by the fireside and his young wife was on a stool at his feet the doctor with a complacent smile was reading aloud some manuscript explanation or statement of a theory out of that interminable dictionary and she was looking up at him but with such a face as i never saw it was so beautiful in its form it was so ashy pale it was so fixed in its abstraction it was so full of a wild sleepwalking dreamy horror of i do not know what the eyes were wide open and her brown hair fell in two rich clusters on her shoulders and on her white dress disordered by the want of the lost ribbon distinctly as i recollect her look i cannot say of what it was expressive i cannot even say of what it is expressive to me now rising again before my older judgement penitence humiliation shame pride love and trustfulnessi see them all and in them all i see that horror of i do not know what my entrance and my saying what i wanted roused her it disturbed the doctor too for when i went back to replace the candle i had taken from the table he was patting her head in his fatherly way and saying he was a merciless drone to let her tempt him into reading on and he would have her go to bed but she asked him in a rapid urgent manner to let her stayto let her feel assured i heard her murmur some broken words to this effect that she was in his confidence that night and as she turned again towards him after glancing at me as i left the room and went out at the door i saw her cross her hands upon his knee and look up at him with the same face something quieted as he resumed his reading it made a great impression on me and i remembered it a long time afterwards as i shall have occasion to narrate when the time comes
