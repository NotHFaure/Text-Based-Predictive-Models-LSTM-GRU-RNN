the emigrants one thing more i had to do before yielding myself to the shock of these emotions it was to conceal what had occurred from those who were going away and to dismiss them on their voyage in happy ignorance in this no time was to be lost i took mr micawber aside that same night and confided to him the task of standing between mr peggotty and intelligence of the late catastrophe he zealously undertook to do so and to intercept any newspaper through which it might without such precautions reach him ‘if it penetrates to him sir’ said mr micawber striking himself on the breast ‘it shall first pass through this body’ mr micawber i must observe in his adaptation of himself to a new state of society had acquired a bold buccaneering air not absolutely lawless but defensive and prompt one might have supposed him a child of the wilderness long accustomed to live out of the confines of civilization and about to return to his native wilds he had provided himself among other things with a complete suit of oilskin and a straw hat with a very low crown pitched or caulked on the outside in this rough clothing with a common mariner’s telescope under his arm and a shrewd trick of casting up his eye at the sky as looking out for dirty weather he was far more nautical after his manner than mr peggotty his whole family if i may so express it were cleared for action i found mrs micawber in the closest and most uncompromising of bonnets made fast under the chin and in a shawl which tied her up as i had been tied up when my aunt first received me like a bundle and was secured behind at the waist in a strong knot miss micawber i found made snug for stormy weather in the same manner with nothing superfluous about her master micawber was hardly visible in a guernsey shirt and the shaggiest suit of slops i ever saw and the children were done up like preserved meats in impervious cases both mr micawber and his eldest son wore their sleeves loosely turned back at the wrists as being ready to lend a hand in any direction and to ‘tumble up’ or sing out ‘yeoheaveyeo’ on the shortest notice thus traddles and i found them at nightfall assembled on the wooden steps at that time known as hungerford stairs watching the departure of a boat with some of their property on board i had told traddles of the terrible event and it had greatly shocked him but there could be no doubt of the kindness of keeping it a secret and he had come to help me in this last service it was here that i took mr micawber aside and received his promise the micawber family were lodged in a little dirty tumbledown publichouse which in those days was close to the stairs and whose protruding wooden rooms overhung the river the family as emigrants being objects of some interest in and about hungerford attracted so many beholders that we were glad to take refuge in their room it was one of the wooden chambers upstairs with the tide flowing underneath my aunt and agnes were there busily making some little extra comforts in the way of dress for the children peggotty was quietly assisting with the old insensible workbox yardmeasure and bit of waxcandle before her that had now outlived so much it was not easy to answer her inquiries still less to whisper mr peggotty when mr micawber brought him in that i had given the letter and all was well but i did both and made them happy if i showed any trace of what i felt my own sorrows were sufficient to account for it ‘and when does the ship sail mr micawber’ asked my aunt mr micawber considered it necessary to prepare either my aunt or his wife by degrees and said sooner than he had expected yesterday ‘the boat brought you word i suppose’ said my aunt ‘it did madam’ he returned ‘well’ said my aunt ‘and she sails’ ‘madam’ he replied ‘i am informed that we must positively be on board before seven tomorrow morning’ ‘heyday’ said my aunt ‘that is soon is it a seagoing fact mr peggotty’ ‘it is so madam she will drop down the river with that theer tide if mas’r davy and my sister comes aboard at gravesen’ arternoon of next day they will see the last on us’ ‘and that we shall do’ said i ‘be sure’ ‘until then and until we are at sea’ observed mr micawber with a glance of intelligence at me ‘mr peggotty and myself will constantly keep a double lookout together on our goods and chattels emma my love’ said mr micawber clearing his throat in his magnificent way ‘my friend mr thomas traddles is so obliging as to solicit in my ear that he should have the privilege of ordering the ingredients necessary to the composition of a moderate portion of that beverage which is peculiarly associated in our minds with the roast beef of old england i allude toin short punch under ordinary circumstances i should scruple to entreat the indulgence of miss trotwood and miss wickfield but’ ‘i can only say for myself’ said my aunt ‘that i will drink all happiness and success to you mr micawber with the utmost pleasure’ ‘and i too’ said agnes with a smile mr micawber immediately descended to the bar where he appeared to be quite at home and in due time returned with a steaming jug i could not but observe that he had been peeling the lemons with his own claspknife which as became the knife of a practical settler was about a foot long and which he wiped not wholly without ostentation on the sleeve of his coat mrs micawber and the two elder members of the family i now found to be provided with similar formidable instruments while every child had its own wooden spoon attached to its body by a strong line in a similar anticipation of life afloat and in the bush mr micawber instead of helping mrs micawber and his eldest son and daughter to punch in wineglasses which he might easily have done for there was a shelffull in the room served it out to them in a series of villainous little tin pots and i never saw him enjoy anything so much as drinking out of his own particular pint pot and putting it in his pocket at the close of the evening ‘the luxuries of the old country’ said mr micawber with an intense satisfaction in their renouncement ‘we abandon the denizens of the forest cannot of course expect to participate in the refinements of the land of the free’ here a boy came in to say that mr micawber was wanted downstairs ‘i have a presentiment’ said mrs micawber setting down her tin pot ‘that it is a member of my family’ ‘if so my dear’ observed mr micawber with his usual suddenness of warmth on that subject ‘as the member of your familywhoever he she or it may behas kept us waiting for a considerable period perhaps the member may now wait my convenience’ ‘micawber’ said his wife in a low tone ‘at such a time as this’ ‘“it is not meet”’ said mr micawber rising ‘“that every nice offence should bear its comment” emma i stand reproved’ ‘the loss micawber’ observed his wife ‘has been my family’s not yours if my family are at length sensible of the deprivation to which their own conduct has in the past exposed them and now desire to extend the hand of fellowship let it not be repulsed’ ‘my dear’ he returned ‘so be it’ ‘if not for their sakes for mine micawber’ said his wife ‘emma’ he returned ‘that view of the question is at such a moment irresistible i cannot even now distinctly pledge myself to fall upon your family’s neck but the member of your family who is now in attendance shall have no genial warmth frozen by me’ mr micawber withdrew and was absent some little time in the course of which mrs micawber was not wholly free from an apprehension that words might have arisen between him and the member at length the same boy reappeared and presented me with a note written in pencil and headed in a legal manner ‘heep v micawber’ from this document i learned that mr micawber being again arrested ‘was in a final paroxysm of despair and that he begged me to send him his knife and pint pot by bearer as they might prove serviceable during the brief remainder of his existence in jail he also requested as a last act of friendship that i would see his family to the parish workhouse and forget that such a being ever lived of course i answered this note by going down with the boy to pay the money where i found mr micawber sitting in a corner looking darkly at the sheriff ‘s officer who had effected the capture on his release he embraced me with the utmost fervour and made an entry of the transaction in his pocketbookbeing very particular i recollect about a halfpenny i inadvertently omitted from my statement of the total this momentous pocketbook was a timely reminder to him of another transaction on our return to the room upstairs where he accounted for his absence by saying that it had been occasioned by circumstances over which he had no control he took out of it a large sheet of paper folded small and quite covered with long sums carefully worked from the glimpse i had of them i should say that i never saw such sums out of a school cipheringbook these it seemed were calculations of compound interest on what he called ‘the principal amount of fortyone ten eleven and a half’ for various periods after a careful consideration of these and an elaborate estimate of his resources he had come to the conclusion to select that sum which represented the amount with compound interest to two years fifteen calendar months and fourteen days from that date for this he had drawn a noteofhand with great neatness which he handed over to traddles on the spot a discharge of his debt in full as between man and man with many acknowledgements ‘i have still a presentiment’ said mrs micawber pensively shaking her head ‘that my family will appear on board before we finally depart’ mr micawber evidently had his presentiment on the subject too but he put it in his tin pot and swallowed it ‘if you have any opportunity of sending letters home on your passage mrs micawber’ said my aunt ‘you must let us hear from you you know’ ‘my dear miss trotwood’ she replied ‘i shall only be too happy to think that anyone expects to hear from us i shall not fail to correspond mr copperfield i trust as an old and familiar friend will not object to receive occasional intelligence himself from one who knew him when the twins were yet unconscious’ i said that i should hope to hear whenever she had an opportunity of writing ‘please heaven there will be many such opportunities’ said mr micawber ‘the ocean in these times is a perfect fleet of ships and we can hardly fail to encounter many in running over it is merely crossing’ said mr micawber trifling with his eyeglass ‘merely crossing the distance is quite imaginary’ i think now how odd it was but how wonderfully like mr micawber that when he went from london to canterbury he should have talked as if he were going to the farthest limits of the earth and when he went from england to australia as if he were going for a little trip across the channel ‘on the voyage i shall endeavour’ said mr micawber ‘occasionally to spin them a yarn and the melody of my son wilkins will i trust be acceptable at the galleyfire when mrs micawber has her sealegs onan expression in which i hope there is no conventional improprietyshe will give them i dare say “little tafflin” porpoises and dolphins i believe will be frequently observed athwart our bows and either on the starboard or the larboard quarter objects of interest will be continually descried in short’ said mr micawber with the old genteel air ‘the probability is all will be found so exciting alow and aloft that when the lookout stationed in the maintop cries landoh we shall be very considerably astonished’ with that he flourished off the contents of his little tin pot as if he had made the voyage and had passed a firstclass examination before the highest naval authorities ‘what i chiefly hope my dear mr copperfield’ said mrs micawber ‘is that in some branches of our family we may live again in the old country do not frown micawber i do not now refer to my own family but to our children’s children however vigorous the sapling’ said mrs micawber shaking her head ‘i cannot forget the parenttree and when our race attains to eminence and fortune i own i should wish that fortune to flow into the coffers of britannia’ ‘my dear’ said mr micawber ‘britannia must take her chance i am bound to say that she has never done much for me and that i have no particular wish upon the subject’ ‘micawber’ returned mrs micawber ‘there you are wrong you are going out micawber to this distant clime to strengthen not to weaken the connexion between yourself and albion’ ‘the connexion in question my love’ rejoined mr micawber ‘has not laid me i repeat under that load of personal obligation that i am at all sensitive as to the formation of another connexion’ ‘micawber’ returned mrs micawber ‘there i again say you are wrong you do not know your power micawber it is that which will strengthen even in this step you are about to take the connexion between yourself and albion’ mr micawber sat in his elbowchair with his eyebrows raised half receiving and half repudiating mrs micawber’s views as they were stated but very sensible of their foresight ‘my dear mr copperfield’ said mrs micawber ‘i wish mr micawber to feel his position it appears to me highly important that mr micawber should from the hour of his embarkation feel his position your old knowledge of me my dear mr copperfield will have told you that i have not the sanguine disposition of mr micawber my disposition is if i may say so eminently practical i know that this is a long voyage i know that it will involve many privations and inconveniences i cannot shut my eyes to those facts but i also know what mr micawber is i know the latent power of mr micawber and therefore i consider it vitally important that mr micawber should feel his position’ ‘my love’ he observed ‘perhaps you will allow me to remark that it is barely possible that i do feel my position at the present moment’ ‘i think not micawber’ she rejoined ‘not fully my dear mr copperfield mr micawber’s is not a common case mr micawber is going to a distant country expressly in order that he may be fully understood and appreciated for the first time i wish mr micawber to take his stand upon that vessel’s prow and firmly say “this country i am come to conquer have you honours have you riches have you posts of profitable pecuniary emolument let them be brought forward they are mine”’ mr micawber glancing at us all seemed to think there was a good deal in this idea ‘i wish mr micawber if i make myself understood’ said mrs micawber in her argumentative tone ‘to be the caesar of his own fortunes that my dear mr copperfield appears to me to be his true position from the first moment of this voyage i wish mr micawber to stand upon that vessel’s prow and say “enough of delay enough of disappointment enough of limited means that was in the old country this is the new produce your reparation bring it forward”’ mr micawber folded his arms in a resolute manner as if he were then stationed on the figurehead ‘and doing that’ said mrs micawber ‘feeling his positionam i not right in saying that mr micawber will strengthen and not weaken his connexion with britain an important public character arising in that hemisphere shall i be told that its influence will not be felt at home can i be so weak as to imagine that mr micawber wielding the rod of talent and of power in australia will be nothing in england i am but a woman but i should be unworthy of myself and of my papa if i were guilty of such absurd weakness’ mrs micawber’s conviction that her arguments were unanswerable gave a moral elevation to her tone which i think i had never heard in it before ‘and therefore it is’ said mrs micawber ‘that i the more wish that at a future period we may live again on the parent soil mr micawber may bei cannot disguise from myself that the probability is mr micawber will bea page of history and he ought then to be represented in the country which gave him birth and did not give him employment’ ‘my love’ observed mr micawber ‘it is impossible for me not to be touched by your affection i am always willing to defer to your good sense what will bewill be heaven forbid that i should grudge my native country any portion of the wealth that may be accumulated by our descendants’ ‘that is well’ said my aunt nodding towards mr peggotty ‘and i drink my love to you all and every blessing and success attend you’ mr peggotty put down the two children he had been nursing one on each knee to join mr and mrs micawber in drinking to all of us in return and when he and the micawbers cordially shook hands as comrades and his brown face brightened with a smile i felt that he would make his way establish a good name and be beloved go where he would even the children were instructed each to dip a wooden spoon into mr micawber’s pot and pledge us in its contents when this was done my aunt and agnes rose and parted from the emigrants it was a sorrowful farewell they were all crying the children hung about agnes to the last and we left poor mrs micawber in a very distressed condition sobbing and weeping by a dim candle that must have made the room look from the river like a miserable lighthouse i went down again next morning to see that they were away they had departed in a boat as early as five of the clock it was a wonderful instance to me of the gap such partings make that although my association of them with the tumbledown publichouse and the wooden stairs dated only from last night both seemed dreary and deserted now that they were gone in the afternoon of the next day my old nurse and i went down to gravesend we found the ship in the river surrounded by a crowd of boats a favourable wind blowing the signal for sailing at her masthead i hired a boat directly and we put off to her and getting through the little vortex of confusion of which she was the centre went on board mr peggotty was waiting for us on deck he told me that mr micawber had just now been arrested again and for the last time at the suit of heep and that in compliance with a request i had made to him he had paid the money which i repaid him he then took us down between decks and there any lingering fears i had of his having heard any rumours of what had happened were dispelled by mr micawber’s coming out of the gloom taking his arm with an air of friendship and protection and telling me that they had scarcely been asunder for a moment since the night before last it was such a strange scene to me and so confined and dark that at first i could make out hardly anything but by degrees it cleared as my eyes became more accustomed to the gloom and i seemed to stand in a picture by ostade among the great beams bulks and ringbolts of the ship and the emigrantberths and chests and bundles and barrels and heaps of miscellaneous baggage‘lighted up here and there by dangling lanterns and elsewhere by the yellow daylight straying down a windsail or a hatchwaywere crowded groups of people making new friendships taking leave of one another talking laughing crying eating and drinking some already settled down into the possession of their few feet of space with their little households arranged and tiny children established on stools or in dwarf elbowchairs others despairing of a restingplace and wandering disconsolately from babies who had but a week or two of life behind them to crooked old men and women who seemed to have but a week or two of life before them and from ploughmen bodily carrying out soil of england on their boots to smiths taking away samples of its soot and smoke upon their skins every age and occupation appeared to be crammed into the narrow compass of the ‘tween decks as my eye glanced round this place i thought i saw sitting by an open port with one of the micawber children near her a figure like emily’s it first attracted my attention by another figure parting from it with a kiss and as it glided calmly away through the disorder reminding me ofagnes but in the rapid motion and confusion and in the unsettlement of my own thoughts i lost it again and only knew that the time was come when all visitors were being warned to leave the ship that my nurse was crying on a chest beside me and that mrs gummidge assisted by some younger stooping woman in black was busily arranging mr peggotty’s goods ‘is there any last wured mas’r davy’ said he ‘is there any one forgotten thing afore we parts’ ‘one thing’ said i ‘martha’ he touched the younger woman i have mentioned on the shoulder and martha stood before me ‘heaven bless you you good man’ cried i ‘you take her with you’ she answered for him with a burst of tears i could speak no more at that time but i wrung his hand and if ever i have loved and honoured any man i loved and honoured that man in my soul the ship was clearing fast of strangers the greatest trial that i had remained i told him what the noble spirit that was gone had given me in charge to say at parting it moved him deeply but when he charged me in return with many messages of affection and regret for those deaf ears he moved me more the time was come i embraced him took my weeping nurse upon my arm and hurried away on deck i took leave of poor mrs micawber she was looking distractedly about for her family even then and her last words to me were that she never would desert mr micawber we went over the side into our boat and lay at a little distance to see the ship wafted on her course it was then calm radiant sunset she lay between us and the red light and every taper line and spar was visible against the glow a sight at once so beautiful so mournful and so hopeful as the glorious ship lying still on the flushed water with all the life on board her crowded at the bulwarks and there clustering for a moment bareheaded and silent i never saw silent only for a moment as the sails rose to the wind and the ship began to move there broke from all the boats three resounding cheers which those on board took up and echoed back and which were echoed and reechoed my heart burst out when i heard the sound and beheld the waving of the hats and handkerchiefsand then i saw her then i saw her at her uncle’s side and trembling on his shoulder he pointed to us with an eager hand and she saw us and waved her last goodbye to me aye emily beautiful and drooping cling to him with the utmost trust of thy bruised heart for he has clung to thee with all the might of his great love surrounded by the rosy light and standing high upon the deck apart together she clinging to him and he holding her they solemnly passed away the night had fallen on the kentish hills when we were rowed ashoreand fallen darkly upon me
