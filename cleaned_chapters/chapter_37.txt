a little cold water my new life had lasted for more than a week and i was stronger than ever in those tremendous practical resolutions that i felt the crisis required i continued to walk extremely fast and to have a general idea that i was getting on i made it a rule to take as much out of myself as i possibly could in my way of doing everything to which i applied my energies i made a perfect victim of myself i even entertained some idea of putting myself on a vegetable diet vaguely conceiving that in becoming a graminivorous animal i should sacrifice to dora as yet little dora was quite unconscious of my desperate firmness otherwise than as my letters darkly shadowed it forth but another saturday came and on that saturday evening she was to be at miss mills’s and when mr mills had gone to his whistclub telegraphed to me in the street by a birdcage in the drawingroom middle window i was to go there to tea by this time we were quite settled down in buckingham street where mr dick continued his copying in a state of absolute felicity my aunt had obtained a signal victory over mrs crupp by paying her off throwing the first pitcher she planted on the stairs out of window and protecting in person up and down the staircase a supernumerary whom she engaged from the outer world these vigorous measures struck such terror to the breast of mrs crupp that she subsided into her own kitchen under the impression that my aunt was mad my aunt being supremely indifferent to mrs crupp’s opinion and everybody else’s and rather favouring than discouraging the idea mrs crupp of late the bold became within a few days so fainthearted that rather than encounter my aunt upon the staircase she would endeavour to hide her portly form behind doorsleaving visible however a wide margin of flannel petticoator would shrink into dark corners this gave my aunt such unspeakable satisfaction that i believe she took a delight in prowling up and down with her bonnet insanely perched on the top of her head at times when mrs crupp was likely to be in the way my aunt being uncommonly neat and ingenious made so many little improvements in our domestic arrangements that i seemed to be richer instead of poorer among the rest she converted the pantry into a dressingroom for me and purchased and embellished a bedstead for my occupation which looked as like a bookcase in the daytime as a bedstead could i was the object of her constant solicitude and my poor mother herself could not have loved me better or studied more how to make me happy peggotty had considered herself highly privileged in being allowed to participate in these labours and although she still retained something of her old sentiment of awe in reference to my aunt had received so many marks of encouragement and confidence that they were the best friends possible but the time had now come i am speaking of the saturday when i was to take tea at miss mills’s when it was necessary for her to return home and enter on the discharge of the duties she had undertaken in behalf of ham ‘so goodbye barkis’ said my aunt ‘and take care of yourself i am sure i never thought i could be sorry to lose you’ i took peggotty to the coach office and saw her off she cried at parting and confided her brother to my friendship as ham had done we had heard nothing of him since he went away that sunny afternoon ‘and now my own dear davy’ said peggotty ‘if while you are a prentice you should want any money to spend or if when you are out of your time my dear you should want any to set you up and you must do one or other or both my darling who has such a good right to ask leave to lend it you as my sweet girl’s own old stupid me’ i was not so savagely independent as to say anything in reply but that if ever i borrowed money of anyone i would borrow it of her next to accepting a large sum on the spot i believe this gave peggotty more comfort than anything i could have done ‘and my dear’ whispered peggotty ‘tell the pretty little angel that i should so have liked to see her only for a minute and tell her that before she marries my boy i will come and make your house so beautiful for you if you will let me’ i declared that nobody else should touch it and this gave peggotty such delight that she went away in good spirits i fatigued myself as much as i possibly could in the commons all day by a variety of devices and at the appointed time in the evening repaired to mr mills’s street mr mills who was a terrible fellow to fall asleep after dinner had not yet gone out and there was no birdcage in the middle window he kept me waiting so long that i fervently hoped the club would fine him for being late at last he came out and then i saw my own dora hang up the birdcage and peep into the balcony to look for me and run in again when she saw i was there while jip remained behind to bark injuriously at an immense butcher’s dog in the street who could have taken him like a pill dora came to the drawingroom door to meet me and jip came scrambling out tumbling over his own growls under the impression that i was a bandit and we all three went in as happy and loving as could be i soon carried desolation into the bosom of our joysnot that i meant to do it but that i was so full of the subjectby asking dora without the smallest preparation if she could love a beggar my pretty little startled dora her only association with the word was a yellow face and a nightcap or a pair of crutches or a wooden leg or a dog with a decanterstand in his mouth or something of that kind and she stared at me with the most delightful wonder ‘how can you ask me anything so foolish’ pouted dora ‘love a beggar’ ‘dora my own dearest’ said i ‘i am a beggar’ ‘how can you be such a silly thing’ replied dora slapping my hand ‘as to sit there telling such stories i will make jip bite you’ her childish way was the most delicious way in the world to me but it was necessary to be explicit and i solemnly repeated ‘dora my own life i am your ruined david’ ‘i declare i will make jip bite you’ said dora shaking her curls ‘if you are so ridiculous’ but i looked so serious that dora left off shaking her curls and laid her trembling little hand upon my shoulder and first looked scared and anxious then began to cry that was dreadful i fell upon my knees before the sofa caressing her and imploring her not to rend my heart but for some time poor little dora did nothing but exclaim oh dear oh dear and oh she was so frightened and where was julia mills and oh take her to julia mills and go away please until i was almost beside myself at last after an agony of supplication and protestation i got dora to look at me with a horrified expression of face which i gradually soothed until it was only loving and her soft pretty cheek was lying against mine then i told her with my arms clasped round her how i loved her so dearly and so dearly how i felt it right to offer to release her from her engagement because now i was poor how i never could bear it or recover it if i lost her how i had no fears of poverty if she had none my arm being nerved and my heart inspired by her how i was already working with a courage such as none but lovers knew how i had begun to be practical and look into the future how a crust well earned was sweeter far than a feast inherited and much more to the same purpose which i delivered in a burst of passionate eloquence quite surprising to myself though i had been thinking about it day and night ever since my aunt had astonished me ‘is your heart mine still dear dora’ said i rapturously for i knew by her clinging to me that it was ‘oh yes’ cried dora ‘oh yes it is all yours oh do not be dreadful’ i dreadful to dora ‘do not talk about being poor and working hard’ said dora nestling closer to me ‘oh do not do not’ ‘my dearest love’ said i ‘the crust wellearned’ ‘oh yes but i do not want to hear any more about crusts’ said dora ‘and jip must have a muttonchop every day at twelve or he will die’ i was charmed with her childish winning way i fondly explained to dora that jip should have his muttonchop with his accustomed regularity i drew a picture of our frugal home made independent by my laboursketching in the little house i had seen at highgate and my aunt in her room upstairs ‘i am not dreadful now dora’ said i tenderly ‘oh no no’ cried dora ‘but i hope your aunt will keep in her own room a good deal and i hope she is not a scolding old thing’ if it were possible for me to love dora more than ever i am sure i did but i felt she was a little impracticable it damped my newborn ardour to find that ardour so difficult of communication to her i made another trial when she was quite herself again and was curling jip’s ears as he lay upon her lap i became grave and said ‘my own may i mention something’ ‘oh please do not be practical’ said dora coaxingly ‘because it frightens me so’ ‘sweetheart’ i returned ‘there is nothing to alarm you in all this i want you to think of it quite differently i want to make it nerve you and inspire you dora’ ‘oh but that is so shocking’ cried dora ‘my love no perseverance and strength of character will enable us to bear much worse things’ ‘but i have not got any strength at all’ said dora shaking her curls ‘have i jip oh do kiss jip and be agreeable’ it was impossible to resist kissing jip when she held him up to me for that purpose putting her own bright rosy little mouth into kissing form as she directed the operation which she insisted should be performed symmetrically on the centre of his nose i did as she bade merewarding myself afterwards for my obedienceand she charmed me out of my graver character for i do not know how long ‘but dora my beloved’ said i at last resuming it ‘i was going to mention something’ the judge of the prerogative court might have fallen in love with her to see her fold her little hands and hold them up begging and praying me not to be dreadful any more ‘indeed i am not going to be my darling’ i assured her ‘but dora my love if you will sometimes thinknot despondingly you know far from thatbut if you will sometimes thinkjust to encourage yourselfthat you are engaged to a poor man’ ‘do not do not pray do not’ cried dora ‘it is so very dreadful’ ‘my soul not at all’ said i cheerfully ‘if you will sometimes think of that and look about now and then at your papa’s housekeeping and endeavour to acquire a little habitof accounts for instance’ poor little dora received this suggestion with something that was half a sob and half a scream ‘it would be so useful to us afterwards’ i went on ‘and if you would promise me to read a littlea little cookery book that i would send you it would be so excellent for both of us for our path in life my dora’ said i warming with the subject ‘is stony and rugged now and it rests with us to smooth it we must fight our way onward we must be brave there are obstacles to be met and we must meet and crush them’ i was going on at a great rate with a clenched hand and a most enthusiastic countenance but it was quite unnecessary to proceed i had said enough i had done it again oh she was so frightened oh where was julia mills oh take her to julia mills and go away please so that in short i was quite distracted and raved about the drawingroom i thought i had killed her this time i sprinkled water on her face i went down on my knees i plucked at my hair i denounced myself as a remorseless brute and a ruthless beast i implored her forgiveness i besought her to look up i ravaged miss mills’s workbox for a smellingbottle and in my agony of mind applied an ivory needlecase instead and dropped all the needles over dora i shook my fists at jip who was as frantic as myself i did every wild extravagance that could be done and was a long way beyond the end of my wits when miss mills came into the room ‘who has done this’ exclaimed miss mills succouring her friend i replied ‘i miss mills i have done it behold the destroyer’or words to that effectand hid my face from the light in the sofa cushion at first miss mills thought it was a quarrel and that we were verging on the desert of sahara but she soon found out how matters stood for my dear affectionate little dora embracing her began exclaiming that i was ‘a poor labourer’ and then cried for me and embraced me and asked me would i let her give me all her money to keep and then fell on miss mills’s neck sobbing as if her tender heart were broken miss mills must have been born to be a blessing to us she ascertained from me in a few words what it was all about comforted dora and gradually convinced her that i was not a labourerfrom my manner of stating the case i believe dora concluded that i was a navigator and went balancing myself up and down a plank all day with a wheelbarrowand so brought us together in peace when we were quite composed and dora had gone upstairs to put some rosewater to her eyes miss mills rang for tea in the ensuing interval i told miss mills that she was evermore my friend and that my heart must cease to vibrate ere i could forget her sympathy i then expounded to miss mills what i had endeavoured so very unsuccessfully to expound to dora miss mills replied on general principles that the cottage of content was better than the palace of cold splendour and that where love was all was i said to miss mills that this was very true and who should know it better than i who loved dora with a love that never mortal had experienced yet but on miss mills observing with despondency that it were well indeed for some hearts if this were so i explained that i begged leave to restrict the observation to mortals of the masculine gender i then put it to miss mills to say whether she considered that there was or was not any practical merit in the suggestion i had been anxious to make concerning the accounts the housekeeping and the cookery book miss mills after some consideration thus replied ‘mr copperfield i will be plain with you mental suffering and trial supply in some natures the place of years and i will be as plain with you as if i were a lady abbess no the suggestion is not appropriate to our dora our dearest dora is a favourite child of nature she is a thing of light and airiness and joy i am free to confess that if it could be done it might be well but’ and miss mills shook her head i was encouraged by this closing admission on the part of miss mills to ask her whether for dora’s sake if she had any opportunity of luring her attention to such preparations for an earnest life she would avail herself of it miss mills replied in the affirmative so readily that i further asked her if she would take charge of the cookery book and if she ever could insinuate it upon dora’s acceptance without frightening her undertake to do me that crowning service miss mills accepted this trust too but was not sanguine and dora returned looking such a lovely little creature that i really doubted whether she ought to be troubled with anything so ordinary and she loved me so much and was so captivating particularly when she made jip stand on his hind legs for toast and when she pretended to hold that nose of his against the hot teapot for punishment because he would not that i felt like a sort of monster who had got into a fairy’s bower when i thought of having frightened her and made her cry after tea we had the guitar and dora sang those same dear old french songs about the impossibility of ever on any account leaving off dancing la ra la la ra la until i felt a much greater monster than before we had only one check to our pleasure and that happened a little while before i took my leave when miss mills chancing to make some allusion to tomorrow morning i unluckily let out that being obliged to exert myself now i got up at five of the clock whether dora had any idea that i was a private watchman i am unable to say but it made a great impression on her and she neither played nor sang any more it was still on her mind when i bade her adieu and she said to me in her pretty coaxing wayas if i were a doll i used to think ‘now do not get up at five of the clock you naughty boy it is so nonsensical’ ‘my love’ said i ‘i have work to do’ ‘but do not do it’ returned dora ‘why should you’ it was impossible to say to that sweet little surprised face otherwise than lightly and playfully that we must work to live ‘oh how ridiculous’ cried dora ‘how shall we live without dora’ said i ‘how any how’ said dora she seemed to think she had quite settled the question and gave me such a triumphant little kiss direct from her innocent heart that i would hardly have put her out of conceit with her answer for a fortune well i loved her and i went on loving her most absorbingly entirely and completely but going on too working pretty hard and busily keeping redhot all the irons i now had in the fire i would sit sometimes of a night opposite my aunt thinking how i had frightened dora that time and how i could best make my way with a guitarcase through the forest of difficulty until i used to fancy that my head was turning quite grey
