a retrospect my schooldays the silent gliding on of my existencethe unseen unfelt progress of my lifefrom childhood up to youth let me think as i look back upon that flowing water now a dry channel overgrown with leaves whether there are any marks along its course by which i can remember how it ran a moment and i occupy my place in the cathedral where we all went together every sunday morning assembling first at school for that purpose the earthy smell the sunless air the sensation of the world being shut out the resounding of the organ through the black and white arched galleries and aisles are wings that take me back and hold me hovering above those days in a halfsleeping and halfwaking dream i am not the last boy in the school i have risen in a few months over several heads but the first boy seems to me a mighty creature dwelling afar off whose giddy height is unattainable agnes says ‘no’ but i say ‘yes’ and tell her that she little thinks what stores of knowledge have been mastered by the wonderful being at whose place she thinks i even i weak aspirant may arrive in time he is not my private friend and public patron as steerforth was but i hold him in a reverential respect i chiefly wonder what he will be when he leaves doctor strong’s and what mankind will do to maintain any place against him but who is this that breaks upon me this is miss shepherd whom i love miss shepherd is a boarder at the misses nettingalls’ establishment i adore miss shepherd she is a little girl in a spencer with a round face and curly flaxen hair the misses nettingalls’ young ladies come to the cathedral too i cannot look upon my book for i must look upon miss shepherd when the choristers chaunt i hear miss shepherd in the service i mentally insert miss shepherd’s namei put her in among the royal family at home in my own room i am sometimes moved to cry out ‘oh miss shepherd’ in a transport of love for some time i am doubtful of miss shepherd’s feelings but at length fate being propitious we meet at the dancingschool i have miss shepherd for my partner i touch miss shepherd’s glove and feel a thrill go up the right arm of my jacket and come out at my hair i say nothing to miss shepherd but we understand each other miss shepherd and myself live but to be united why do i secretly give miss shepherd twelve brazil nuts for a present i wonder they are not expressive of affection they are difficult to pack into a parcel of any regular shape they are hard to crack even in room doors and they are oily when cracked yet i feel that they are appropriate to miss shepherd soft seedy biscuits also i bestow upon miss shepherd and oranges innumerable once i kiss miss shepherd in the cloakroom ecstasy what are my agony and indignation next day when i hear a flying rumour that the misses nettingall have stood miss shepherd in the stocks for turning in her toes miss shepherd being the one pervading theme and vision of my life how do i ever come to break with her i cannot conceive and yet a coolness grows between miss shepherd and myself whispers reach me of miss shepherd having said she wished i would not stare so and having avowed a preference for master jonesfor jones a boy of no merit whatever the gulf between me and miss shepherd widens at last one day i meet the misses nettingalls’ establishment out walking miss shepherd makes a face as she goes by and laughs to her companion all is over the devotion of a lifeit seems a life it is all the sameis at an end miss shepherd comes out of the morning service and the royal family know her no more i am higher in the school and no one breaks my peace i am not at all polite now to the misses nettingalls’ young ladies and should not dote on any of them if they were twice as many and twenty times as beautiful i think the dancingschool a tiresome affair and wonder why the girls cannot dance by themselves and leave us alone i am growing great in latin verses and neglect the laces of my boots doctor strong refers to me in public as a promising young scholar mr dick is wild with joy and my aunt remits me a guinea by the next post the shade of a young butcher rises like the apparition of an armed head in macbeth who is this young butcher he is the terror of the youth of canterbury there is a vague belief abroad that the beef suet with which he anoints his hair gives him unnatural strength and that he is a match for a man he is a broadfaced bullnecked young butcher with rough red cheeks an illconditioned mind and an injurious tongue his main use of this tongue is to disparage doctor strong’s young gentlemen he says publicly that if they want anything he will give it ‘them he names individuals among them myself included whom he could undertake to settle with one hand and the other tied behind him he waylays the smaller boys to punch their unprotected heads and calls challenges after me in the open streets for these sufficient reasons i resolve to fight the butcher it is a summer evening down in a green hollow at the corner of a wall i meet the butcher by appointment i am attended by a select body of our boys the butcher by two other butchers a young publican and a sweep the preliminaries are adjusted and the butcher and myself stand face to face in a moment the butcher lights ten thousand candles out of my left eyebrow in another moment i do not know where the wall is or where i am or where anybody is i hardly know which is myself and which the butcher we are always in such a tangle and tussle knocking about upon the trodden grass sometimes i see the butcher bloody but confident sometimes i see nothing and sit gasping on my second’s knee sometimes i go in at the butcher madly and cut my knuckles open against his face without appearing to discompose him at all at last i awake very queer about the head as from a giddy sleep and see the butcher walking off congratulated by the two other butchers and the sweep and publican and putting on his coat as he goes from which i augur justly that the victory is his i am taken home in a sad plight and i have beefsteaks put to my eyes and am rubbed with vinegar and brandy and find a great puffy place bursting out on my upper lip which swells immoderately for three or four days i remain at home a very illlooking subject with a green shade over my eyes and i should be very dull but that agnes is a sister to me and condoles with me and reads to me and makes the time light and happy agnes has my confidence completely always i tell her all about the butcher and the wrongs he has heaped upon me she thinks i could not have done otherwise than fight the butcher while she shrinks and trembles at my having fought him time has stolen on unobserved for adams is not the headboy in the days that are come now nor has he been this many and many a day adams has left the school so long that when he comes back on a visit to doctor strong there are not many there besides myself who know him adams is going to be called to the bar almost directly and is to be an advocate and to wear a wig i am surprised to find him a meeker man than i had thought and less imposing in appearance he has not staggered the world yet either for it goes on as well as i can make out pretty much the same as if he had never joined it a blank through which the warriors of poetry and history march on in stately hosts that seem to have no endand what comes next i am the headboy now i look down on the line of boys below me with a condescending interest in such of them as bring to my mind the boy i was myself when i first came there that little fellow seems to be no part of me i remember him as something left behind upon the road of lifeas something i have passed rather than have actually beenand almost think of him as of someone else and the little girl i saw on that first day at mr wickfield’s where is she gone also in her stead the perfect likeness of the picture a child likeness no more moves about the house and agnesmy sweet sister as i call her in my thoughts my counsellor and friend the better angel of the lives of all who come within her calm good selfdenying influenceis quite a woman what other changes have come upon me besides the changes in my growth and looks and in the knowledge i have garnered all this while i wear a gold watch and chain a ring upon my little finger and a longtailed coat and i use a great deal of bear’s greasewhich taken in conjunction with the ring looks bad am i in love again i am i worship the eldest miss larkins the eldest miss larkins is not a little girl she is a tall dark blackeyed fine figure of a woman the eldest miss larkins is not a chicken for the youngest miss larkins is not that and the eldest must be three or four years older perhaps the eldest miss larkins may be about thirty my passion for her is beyond all bounds the eldest miss larkins knows officers it is an awful thing to bear i see them speaking to her in the street i see them cross the way to meet her when her bonnet she has a bright taste in bonnets is seen coming down the pavement accompanied by her sister’s bonnet she laughs and talks and seems to like it i spend a good deal of my own spare time in walking up and down to meet her if i can bow to her once in the day i know her to bow to knowing mr larkins i am happier i deserve a bow now and then the raging agonies i suffer on the night of the race ball where i know the eldest miss larkins will be dancing with the military ought to have some compensation if there be evenhanded justice in the world my passion takes away my appetite and makes me wear my newest silk neckerchief continually i have no relief but in putting on my best clothes and having my boots cleaned over and over again i seem then to be worthier of the eldest miss larkins everything that belongs to her or is connected with her is precious to me mr larkins a gruff old gentleman with a double chin and one of his eyes immovable in his head is fraught with interest to me when i cannot meet his daughter i go where i am likely to meet him to say ‘how do you do mr larkins are the young ladies and all the family quite well’ seems so pointed that i blush i think continually about my age say i am seventeen and say that seventeen is young for the eldest miss larkins what of that besides i shall be oneandtwenty in no time almost i regularly take walks outside mr larkins’s house in the evening though it cuts me to the heart to see the officers go in or to hear them up in the drawingroom where the eldest miss larkins plays the harp i even walk on two or three occasions in a sickly spoony manner round and round the house after the family are gone to bed wondering which is the eldest miss larkins’s chamber and pitching i dare say now on mr larkins’s instead wishing that a fire would burst out that the assembled crowd would stand appalled that i dashing through them with a ladder might rear it against her window save her in my arms go back for something she had left behind and perish in the flames for i am generally disinterested in my love and think i could be content to make a figure before miss larkins and expire generally but not always sometimes brighter visions rise before me when i dress the occupation of two hours for a great ball given at the larkins’s the anticipation of three weeks i indulge my fancy with pleasing images i picture myself taking courage to make a declaration to miss larkins i picture miss larkins sinking her head upon my shoulder and saying ‘oh mr copperfield can i believe my ears’ i picture mr larkins waiting on me next morning and saying ‘my dear copperfield my daughter has told me all youth is no objection here are twenty thousand pounds be happy’ i picture my aunt relenting and blessing us and mr dick and doctor strong being present at the marriage ceremony i am a sensible fellow i believei believe on looking back i meanand modest i am sure but all this goes on notwithstanding i repair to the enchanted house where there are lights chattering music flowers officers i am sorry to see and the eldest miss larkins a blaze of beauty she is dressed in blue with blue flowers in her hairforgetmenotsas if she had any need to wear forgetmenots it is the first really grownup party that i have ever been invited to and i am a little uncomfortable for i appear not to belong to anybody and nobody appears to have anything to say to me except mr larkins who asks me how my schoolfellows are which he need not do as i have not come there to be insulted but after i have stood in the doorway for some time and feasted my eyes upon the goddess of my heart she approaches meshe the eldest miss larkinsand asks me pleasantly if i dance i stammer with a bow ‘with you miss larkins’ ‘with no one else’ inquires miss larkins ‘i should have no pleasure in dancing with anyone else’ miss larkins laughs and blushes or i think she blushes and says ‘next time but one i shall be very glad’ the time arrives ‘it is a waltz i think’ miss larkins doubtfully observes when i present myself ‘do you waltz if not captain bailey’ but i do waltz pretty well too as it happens and i take miss larkins out i take her sternly from the side of captain bailey he is wretched i have no doubt but he is nothing to me i have been wretched too i waltz with the eldest miss larkins i do not know where among whom or how long i only know that i swim about in space with a blue angel in a state of blissful delirium until i find myself alone with her in a little room resting on a sofa she admires a flower pink camellia japonica price halfacrown in my buttonhole i give it her and say ‘i ask an inestimable price for it miss larkins’ ‘indeed what is that’ returns miss larkins ‘a flower of yours that i may treasure it as a miser does gold’ ‘you are a bold boy’ says miss larkins ‘there’ she gives it me not displeased and i put it to my lips and then into my breast miss larkins laughing draws her hand through my arm and says ‘now take me back to captain bailey’ i am lost in the recollection of this delicious interview and the waltz when she comes to me again with a plain elderly gentleman who has been playing whist all night upon her arm and says ‘oh here is my bold friend mr chestle wants to know you mr copperfield’ i feel at once that he is a friend of the family and am much gratified ‘i admire your taste sir’ says mr chestle ‘it does you credit i suppose you do not take much interest in hops but i am a pretty large grower myself and if you ever like to come over to our neighbourhoodneighbourhood of ashfordand take a run about our placewe shall be glad for you to stop as long as you like’ i thank mr chestle warmly and shake hands i think i am in a happy dream i waltz with the eldest miss larkins once again she says i waltz so well i go home in a state of unspeakable bliss and waltz in imagination all night long with my arm round the blue waist of my dear divinity for some days afterwards i am lost in rapturous reflections but i neither see her in the street nor when i call i am imperfectly consoled for this disappointment by the sacred pledge the perished flower ‘trotwood’ says agnes one day after dinner ‘who do you think is going to be married tomorrow someone you admire’ ‘not you i suppose agnes’ ‘not me’ raising her cheerful face from the music she is copying ‘do you hear him papathe eldest miss larkins’ ‘toto captain bailey’ i have just enough power to ask ‘no to no captain to mr chestle a hopgrower’ i am terribly dejected for about a week or two i take off my ring i wear my worst clothes i use no bear’s grease and i frequently lament over the late miss larkins’s faded flower being by that time rather tired of this kind of life and having received new provocation from the butcher i throw the flower away go out with the butcher and gloriously defeat him this and the resumption of my ring as well as of the bear’s grease in moderation are the last marks i can discern now in my progress to seventeen
