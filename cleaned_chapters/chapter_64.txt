a last retrospect and now my written story ends i look back once morefor the last timebefore i close these leaves i see myself with agnes at my side journeying along the road of life i see our children and our friends around us and i hear the roar of many voices not indifferent to me as i travel on what faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd lo these all turning to me as i ask my thoughts the question here is my aunt in stronger spectacles an old woman of fourscore years and more but upright yet and a steady walker of six miles at a stretch in winter weather always with her here comes peggotty my good old nurse likewise in spectacles accustomed to do needlework at night very close to the lamp but never sitting down to it without a bit of wax candle a yardmeasure in a little house and a workbox with a picture of st paul’s upon the lid the cheeks and arms of peggotty so hard and red in my childish days when i wondered why the birds did not peck her in preference to apples are shrivelled now and her eyes that used to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face are fainter though they glitter still but her rough forefinger which i once associated with a pocket nutmeggrater is just the same and when i see my least child catching at it as it totters from my aunt to her i think of our little parlour at home when i could scarcely walk my aunt’s old disappointment is set right now she is godmother to a real living betsey trotwood and dora the next in order says she spoils her there is something bulky in peggotty’s pocket it is nothing smaller than the crocodile book which is in rather a dilapidated condition by this time with divers of the leaves torn and stitched across but which peggotty exhibits to the children as a precious relic i find it very curious to see my own infant face looking up at me from the crocodile stories and to be reminded by it of my old acquaintance brooks of sheffield among my boys this summer holiday time i see an old man making giant kites and gazing at them in the air with a delight for which there are no words he greets me rapturously and whispers with many nods and winks ‘trotwood you will be glad to hear that i shall finish the memorial when i have nothing else to do and that your aunt’s the most extraordinary woman in the world sir’ who is this bent lady supporting herself by a stick and showing me a countenance in which there are some traces of old pride and beauty feebly contending with a querulous imbecile fretful wandering of the mind she is in a garden and near her stands a sharp dark withered woman with a white scar on her lip let me hear what they say ‘rosa i have forgotten this gentleman’s name’ rosa bends over her and calls to her ‘mr copperfield’ ‘i am glad to see you sir i am sorry to observe you are in mourning i hope time will be good to you’ her impatient attendant scolds her tells her i am not in mourning bids her look again tries to rouse her ‘you have seen my son sir’ says the elder lady ‘are you reconciled’ looking fixedly at me she puts her hand to her forehead and moans suddenly she cries in a terrible voice ‘rosa come to me he is dead’ rosa kneeling at her feet by turns caresses her and quarrels with her now fiercely telling her ‘i loved him better than you ever did’now soothing her to sleep on her breast like a sick child thus i leave them thus i always find them thus they wear their time away from year to year what ship comes sailing home from india and what english lady is this married to a growling old scotch croesus with great flaps of ears can this be julia mills indeed it is julia mills peevish and fine with a black man to carry cards and letters to her on a golden salver and a coppercoloured woman in linen with a bright handkerchief round her head to serve her tiffin in her dressingroom but julia keeps no diary in these days never sings affection’s dirge eternally quarrels with the old scotch croesus who is a sort of yellow bear with a tanned hide julia is steeped in money to the throat and talks and thinks of nothing else i liked her better in the desert of sahara or perhaps this is the desert of sahara for though julia has a stately house and mighty company and sumptuous dinners every day i see no green growth near her nothing that can ever come to fruit or flower what julia calls ‘society’ i see among it mr jack maldon from his patent place sneering at the hand that gave it him and speaking to me of the doctor as ‘so charmingly antique’ but when society is the name for such hollow gentlemen and ladies julia and when its breeding is professed indifference to everything that can advance or can retard mankind i think we must have lost ourselves in that same desert of sahara and had better find the way out and lo the doctor always our good friend labouring at his dictionary somewhere about the letter d and happy in his home and wife also the old soldier on a considerably reduced footing and by no means so influential as in days of yore working at his chambers in the temple with a busy aspect and his hair where he is not bald made more rebellious than ever by the constant friction of his lawyer’swig i come in a later time upon my dear old traddles his table is covered with thick piles of papers and i say as i look around me ‘if sophy were your clerk now traddles she would have enough to do’ ‘you may say that my dear copperfield but those were capital days too in holborn court were they not’ ‘when she told you you would be a judge but it was not the town talk then’ ‘at all events’ says traddles ‘if i ever am one’ ‘why you know you will be’ ‘well my dear copperfield when i am one i shall tell the story as i said i would’ we walk away arm in arm i am going to have a family dinner with traddles it is sophy’s birthday and on our road traddles discourses to me of the good fortune he has enjoyed ‘i really have been able my dear copperfield to do all that i had most at heart there is the reverend horace promoted to that living at four hundred and fifty pounds a year there are our two boys receiving the very best education and distinguishing themselves as steady scholars and good fellows there are three of the girls married very comfortably there are three more living with us there are three more keeping house for the reverend horace since mrs crewler’s decease and all of them happy’ ‘except’ i suggest ‘except the beauty’ says traddles ‘yes it was very unfortunate that she should marry such a vagabond but there was a certain dash and glare about him that caught her however now we have got her safe at our house and got rid of him we must cheer her up again’ traddles’s house is one of the very housesor it easily may have beenwhich he and sophy used to parcel out in their evening walks it is a large house but traddles keeps his papers in his dressingroom and his boots with his papers and he and sophy squeeze themselves into upper rooms reserving the best bedrooms for the beauty and the girls there is no room to spare in the house for more of ‘the girls’ are here and always are here by some accident or other than i know how to count here when we go in is a crowd of them running down to the door and handing traddles about to be kissed until he is out of breath here established in perpetuity is the poor beauty a widow with a little girl here at dinner on sophy’s birthday are the three married girls with their three husbands and one of the husband’s brothers and another husband’s cousin and another husband’s sister who appears to me to be engaged to the cousin traddles exactly the same simple unaffected fellow as he ever was sits at the foot of the large table like a patriarch and sophy beams upon him from the head across a cheerful space that is certainly not glittering with britannia metal and now as i close my task subduing my desire to linger yet these faces fade away but one face shining on me like a heavenly light by which i see all other objects is above them and beyond them all and that remains i turn my head and see it in its beautiful serenity beside me my lamp burns low and i have written far into the night but the dear presence without which i were nothing bears me company o agnes o my soul so may thy face be by me when i close my life indeed so may i when realities are melting from me like the shadows which i now dismiss still find thee near me pointing upward
