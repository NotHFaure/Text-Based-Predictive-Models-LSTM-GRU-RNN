another retrospect i must pause yet once again o my childwife there is a figure in the moving crowd before my memory quiet and still saying in its innocent love and childish beauty stop to think of meturn to look upon the little blossom as it flutters to the ground i do all else grows dim and fades away i am again with dora in our cottage i do not know how long she has been ill i am so used to it in feeling that i cannot count the time it is not really long in weeks or months but in my usage and experience it is a weary weary while they have left off telling me to ‘wait a few days more’ i have begun to fear remotely that the day may never shine when i shall see my childwife running in the sunlight with her old friend jip he is as it were suddenly grown very old it may be that he misses in his mistress something that enlivened him and made him younger but he mopes and his sight is weak and his limbs are feeble and my aunt is sorry that he objects to her no more but creeps near her as he lies on dora’s bedshe sitting at the bedsideand mildly licks her hand dora lies smiling on us and is beautiful and utters no hasty or complaining word she says that we are very good to her that her dear old careful boy is tiring himself out she knows that my aunt has no sleep yet is always wakeful active and kind sometimes the little birdlike ladies come to see her and then we talk about our weddingday and all that happy time what a strange rest and pause in my life there seems to beand in all life within doors and withoutwhen i sit in the quiet shaded orderly room with the blue eyes of my childwife turned towards me and her little fingers twining round my hand many and many an hour i sit thus but of all those times three times come the freshest on my mind it is morning and dora made so trim by my aunt’s hands shows me how her pretty hair will curl upon the pillow yet an how long and bright it is and how she likes to have it loosely gathered in that net she wears ‘not that i am vain of it now you mocking boy’ she says when i smile ‘but because you used to say you thought it so beautiful and because when i first began to think about you i used to peep in the glass and wonder whether you would like very much to have a lock of it oh what a foolish fellow you were doady when i gave you one’ ‘that was on the day when you were painting the flowers i had given you dora and when i told you how much in love i was’ ‘ah but i did not like to tell you’ says dora ‘then how i had cried over them because i believed you really liked me when i can run about again as i used to do doady let us go and see those places where we were such a silly couple shall we and take some of the old walks and not forget poor papa’ ‘yes we will and have some happy days so you must make haste to get well my dear’ ‘oh i shall soon do that i am so much better you do not know’ it is evening and i sit in the same chair by the same bed with the same face turned towards me we have been silent and there is a smile upon her face i have ceased to carry my light burden up and down stairs now she lies here all the day ‘doady’ ‘my dear dora’ ‘you will not think what i am going to say unreasonable after what you told me such a little while ago of mr wickfield’s not being well i want to see agnes very much i want to see her’ ‘i will write to her my dear’ ‘will you’ ‘directly’ ‘what a good kind boy doady take me on your arm indeed my dear it is not a whim it is not a foolish fancy i want very much indeed to see her’ ‘i am certain of it i have only to tell her so and she is sure to come’ ‘you are very lonely when you go downstairs now’ dora whispers with her arm about my neck ‘how can i be otherwise my own love when i see your empty chair’ ‘my empty chair’ she clings to me for a little while in silence ‘and you really miss me doady’ looking up and brightly smiling ‘even poor giddy stupid me’ ‘my heart who is there upon earth that i could miss so much’ ‘oh husband i am so glad yet so sorry’ creeping closer to me and folding me in both her arms she laughs and sobs and then is quiet and quite happy ‘quite’ she says ‘only give agnes my dear love and tell her that i want very very much to see her and i have nothing left to wish for’ ‘except to get well again dora’ ‘ah doady sometimes i thinkyou know i always was a silly little thingthat that will never be’ ‘do not say so dora dearest love do not think so’ ‘i will not if i can help it doady but i am very happy though my dear boy is so lonely by himself before his childwife’s empty chair’ it is night and i am with her still agnes has arrived has been among us for a whole day and an evening she my aunt and i have sat with dora since the morning all together we have not talked much but dora has been perfectly contented and cheerful we are now alone do i know now that my childwife will soon leave me they have told me so they have told me nothing new to my thoughtsbut i am far from sure that i have taken that truth to heart i cannot master it i have withdrawn by myself many times today to weep i have remembered who wept for a parting between the living and the dead i have bethought me of all that gracious and compassionate history i have tried to resign myself and to console myself and that i hope i may have done imperfectly but what i cannot firmly settle in my mind is that the end will absolutely come i hold her hand in mine i hold her heart in mine i see her love for me alive in all its strength i cannot shut out a pale lingering shadow of belief that she will be spared ‘i am going to speak to you doady i am going to say something i have often thought of saying lately you will not mind’ with a gentle look ‘mind my darling’ ‘because i do not know what you will think or what you may have thought sometimes perhaps you have often thought the same doady dear i am afraid i was too young’ i lay my face upon the pillow by her and she looks into my eyes and speaks very softly gradually as she goes on i feel with a stricken heart that she is speaking of herself as past ‘i am afraid dear i was too young i do not mean in years only but in experience and thoughts and everything i was such a silly little creature i am afraid it would have been better if we had only loved each other as a boy and girl and forgotten it i have begun to think i was not fit to be a wife’ i try to stay my tears and to reply ‘oh dora love as fit as i to be a husband’ ‘i do not know’ with the old shake of her curls ‘perhaps but if i had been more fit to be married i might have made you more so too besides you are very clever and i never was’ ‘we have been very happy my sweet dora’ ‘i was very happy very but as years went on my dear boy would have wearied of his childwife she would have been less and less a companion for him he would have been more and more sensible of what was wanting in his home she would not have improved it is better as it is’ ‘oh dora dearest dearest do not speak to me so every word seems a reproach’ ‘no not a syllable’ she answers kissing me ‘oh my dear you never deserved it and i loved you far too well to say a reproachful word to you in earnestit was all the merit i had except being prettyor you thought me so is it lonely downstairs doady’ ‘very very’ ‘do not cry is my chair there’ ‘in its old place’ ‘oh how my poor boy cries hush hush now make me one promise i want to speak to agnes when you go downstairs tell agnes so and send her up to me and while i speak to her let no one comenot even aunt i want to speak to agnes by herself i want to speak to agnes quite alone’ i promise that she shall immediately but i cannot leave her for my grief ‘i said that it was better as it is’ she whispers as she holds me in her arms ‘oh doady after more years you never could have loved your childwife better than you do and after more years she would so have tried and disappointed you that you might not have been able to love her half so well i know i was too young and foolish it is much better as it is’ agnes is downstairs when i go into the parlour and i give her the message she disappears leaving me alone with jip his chinese house is by the fire and he lies within it on his bed of flannel querulously trying to sleep the bright moon is high and clear as i look out on the night my tears fall fast and my undisciplined heart is chastened heavilyheavily i sit down by the fire thinking with a blind remorse of all those secret feelings i have nourished since my marriage i think of every little trifle between me and dora and feel the truth that trifles make the sum of life ever rising from the sea of my remembrance is the image of the dear child as i knew her first graced by my young love and by her own with every fascination wherein such love is rich would it indeed have been better if we had loved each other as a boy and a girl and forgotten it undisciplined heart reply how the time wears i know not until i am recalled by my childwife’s old companion more restless than he was he crawls out of his house and looks at me and wanders to the door and whines to go upstairs ‘not tonight jip not tonight’ he comes very slowly back to me licks my hand and lifts his dim eyes to my face ‘oh jip it may be never again’ he lies down at my feet stretches himself out as if to sleep and with a plaintive cry is dead ‘oh agnes look look here’ that face so full of pity and of grief that rain of tears that awful mute appeal to me that solemn hand upraised towards heaven ‘agnes’ it is over darkness comes before my eyes and for a time all things are blotted out of my remembrance
