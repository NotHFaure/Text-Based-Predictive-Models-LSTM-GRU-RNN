a visitor what i have purposed to record is nearly finished but there is yet an incident conspicuous in my memory on which it often rests with delight and without which one thread in the web i have spun would have a ravelled end i had advanced in fame and fortune my domestic joy was perfect i had been married ten happy years agnes and i were sitting by the fire in our house in london one night in spring and three of our children were playing in the room when i was told that a stranger wished to see me he had been asked if he came on business and had answered no he had come for the pleasure of seeing me and had come a long way he was an old man my servant said and looked like a farmer as this sounded mysterious to the children and moreover was like the beginning of a favourite story agnes used to tell them introductory to the arrival of a wicked old fairy in a cloak who hated everybody it produced some commotion one of our boys laid his head in his mother’s lap to be out of harm’s way and little agnes our eldest child left her doll in a chair to represent her and thrust out her little heap of golden curls from between the windowcurtains to see what happened next ‘let him come in here’ said i there soon appeared pausing in the dark doorway as he entered a hale greyhaired old man little agnes attracted by his looks had run to bring him in and i had not yet clearly seen his face when my wife starting up cried out to me in a pleased and agitated voice that it was mr peggotty it was mr peggotty an old man now but in a ruddy hearty strong old age when our first emotion was over and he sat before the fire with the children on his knees and the blaze shining on his face he looked to me as vigorous and robust withal as handsome an old man as ever i had seen ‘mas’r davy’ said he and the old name in the old tone fell so naturally on my ear ‘mas’r davy ‘it is a joyful hour as i see you once more ‘long with your own trew wife’ ‘a joyful hour indeed old friend’ cried i ‘and these heer pretty ones’ said mr peggotty ‘to look at these heer flowers why mas’r davy you was but the heighth of the littlest of these when i first see you when them’ly warn’t no bigger and our poor lad were but a lad’ ‘time has changed me more than it has changed you since then’ said i ‘but let these dear rogues go to bed and as no house in england but this must hold you tell me where to send for your luggage is the old black bag among it that went so far i wonder and then over a glass of yarmouth grog we will have the tidings of ten years’ ‘are you alone’ asked agnes ‘yes madam’ he said kissing her hand ‘quite alone’ we sat him between us not knowing how to give him welcome enough and as i began to listen to his old familiar voice i could have fancied he was still pursuing his long journey in search of his darling niece ‘it is a mort of water’ said mr peggotty ‘fur to come across and on’y stay a matter of fower weeks but water ‘specially when ‘it is salt comes nat’ral to me and friends is dear and i am heer which is verse’ said mr peggotty surprised to find it out ‘though i had not such intentions’ ‘are you going back those many thousand miles so soon’ asked agnes ‘yes madam’ he returned ‘i giv the promise to them’ly afore i come away you see i doen’t grow younger as the years comes round and if i had not sailed as ‘it was most like i should not never have done ‘t and it is allus been on my mind as i must come and see mas’r davy and your own sweet blooming self in your wedded happiness afore i got to be too old’ he looked at us as if he could never feast his eyes on us sufficiently agnes laughingly put back some scattered locks of his grey hair that he might see us better ‘and now tell us’ said i ‘everything relating to your fortunes’ ‘our fortuns mas’r davy’ he rejoined ‘is soon told we have not fared nohows but fared to thrive we have allus thrived we have worked as we ought to ‘t and maybe we lived a leetle hard at first or so but we have allus thrived what with sheepfarming and what with stockfarming and what with one thing and what with t’other we are as well to do as well could be theer’s been kiender a blessing fell upon us’ said mr peggotty reverentially inclining his head ‘and we have done nowt but prosper that is in the long run if not yesterday why then today if not today why then tomorrow’ ‘and emily’ said agnes and i both together ‘them’ly’ said he ‘arter you left her madamand i never heerd her saying of her prayers at night t’other side the canvas screen when we was settled in the bush but what i heerd your nameand arter she and me lost sight of mas’r davy that theer shining sundownwas that low at first that if she had know’d then what mas’r davy kep from us so kind and thowtful ‘it is my opinion she would have drooped away but theer was some poor folks aboard as had illness among ‘them and she took care of them and theer was the children in our company and she took care of them and so she got to be busy and to be doing good and that helped her’ ‘when did she first hear of it’ i asked ‘i kep it from her arter i heerd on ‘t’ said mr peggotty ‘going on nigh a year we was living then in a solitary place but among the beautifullest trees and with the roses acovering our beein to the roof theer come along one day when i was out aworking on the land a traveller from our own norfolk or suffolk in england i doen’t rightly mind which and of course we took him in and giv him to eat and drink and made him welcome we all do that all the colony over he would got an old newspaper with him and some other account in print of the storm that is how she know’d it when i came home at night i found she know’d it’ he dropped his voice as he said these words and the gravity i so well remembered overspread his face ‘did it change her much’ we asked ‘aye for a good long time’ he said shaking his head ‘if not to this present hour but i think the solitoode done her good and she had a deal to mind in the way of poultry and the like and minded of it and come through i wonder’ he said thoughtfully ‘if you could see my them’ly now mas’r davy whether you would know her’ ‘is she so altered’ i inquired ‘i doen’t know i see her ev’ry day and doen’t know but oddtimes i have thowt so a slight figure’ said mr peggotty looking at the fire ‘kiender worn soft sorrowful blue eyes a delicate face a pritty head leaning a little down a quiet voice and waytimid a’most that is them’ly’ we silently observed him as he sat still looking at the fire ‘some thinks’ he said ‘as her affection was illbestowed some as her marriage was broken off by death no one knows how ‘it is she might have married well a mort of times “but uncle” she says to me “that is gone for ever” cheerful along with me retired when others is by fond of going any distance fur to teach a child or fur to tend a sick person or fur to do some kindness tow’rds a young girl’s wedding and she is done a many but has never seen one fondly loving of her uncle patient liked by young and old sowt out by all that has any trouble that is them’ly’ he drew his hand across his face and with a halfsuppressed sigh looked up from the fire ‘is martha with you yet’ i asked ‘martha’ he replied ‘got married mas’r davy in the second year a young man a farmlabourer as come by us on his way to market with his mas’r’s draysa journey of over five hundred mile theer and backmade offers fur to take her fur his wife wives is very scarce theer and then to set up fur their two selves in the bush she spoke to me fur to tell him her trew story i did they was married and they live fower hundred mile away from any voices but their own and the singing birds’ ‘mrs gummidge’ i suggested it was a pleasant key to touch for mr peggotty suddenly burst into a roar of laughter and rubbed his hands up and down his legs as he had been accustomed to do when he enjoyed himself in the longshipwrecked boat ‘would you believe it’ he said ‘why someun even made offer fur to marry her if a ship’s cook that was turning settler mas’r davy did not make offers fur to marry missis gummidge i am gormedand i cannot say no fairer than that’ i never saw agnes laugh so this sudden ecstasy on the part of mr peggotty was so delightful to her that she could not leave off laughing and the more she laughed the more she made me laugh and the greater mr peggotty’s ecstasy became and the more he rubbed his legs ‘and what did mrs gummidge say’ i asked when i was grave enough ‘if you will believe me’ returned mr peggotty ‘missis gummidge ‘stead of saying “thank you i am much obleeged to you i are not agoing fur to change my condition at my time of life” up’d with a bucket as was standing by and laid it over that theer ship’s cook’s head ‘till he sung out fur help and i went in and reskied of him’ mr peggotty burst into a great roar of laughter and agnes and i both kept him company ‘but i must say this for the good creetur’ he resumed wiping his face when we were quite exhausted ‘she has been all she said she would be to us and more she is the willingest the trewest the honestesthelping woman mas’r davy as ever draw’d the breath of life i have never know’d her to be lone and lorn for a single minute not even when the colony was all afore us and we was new to it and thinking of the old ‘un is a thing she never done i do assure you since she left england’ ‘now last not least mr micawber’ said i ‘he has paid off every obligation he incurred hereeven to traddles’s bill you remember my dear agnesand therefore we may take it for granted that he is doing well but what is the latest news of him’ mr peggotty with a smile put his hand in his breastpocket and produced a flatfolded paper parcel from which he took out with much care a little oddlooking newspaper ‘you are to understan’ mas’r davy’ said he ‘as we have left the bush now being so well to do and have gone right away round to port middlebay harbour wheer theer’s what we call a town’ ‘mr micawber was in the bush near you’ said i ‘bless you yes’ said mr peggotty ‘and turned to with a will i never wish to meet a better gen’l’man for turning to with a will i have seen that theer bald head of his a perspiring in the sun mas’r davy till i a’most thowt it would have melted away and now he is a magistrate’ ‘a magistrate eh’ said i mr peggotty pointed to a certain paragraph in the newspaper where i read aloud as follows from the port middlebay times ‘the public dinner to our distinguished fellowcolonist and townsman wilkins micawber esquire port middlebay district magistrate came off yesterday in the large room of the hotel which was crowded to suffocation it is estimated that not fewer than fortyseven persons must have been accommodated with dinner at one time exclusive of the company in the passage and on the stairs the beauty fashion and exclusiveness of port middlebay flocked to do honour to one so deservedly esteemed so highly talented and so widely popular doctor mell of colonial salemhouse grammar school port middlebay presided and on his right sat the distinguished guest after the removal of the cloth and the singing of non nobis beautifully executed and in which we were at no loss to distinguish the belllike notes of that gifted amateur wilkins micawber esquire junior the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were severally given and rapturously received doctor mell in a speech replete with feeling then proposed “our distinguished guest the ornament of our town may he never leave us but to better himself and may his success among us be such as to render his bettering himself impossible” the cheering with which the toast was received defies description again and again it rose and fell like the waves of ocean at length all was hushed and wilkins micawber esquire presented himself to return thanks far be it from us in the present comparatively imperfect state of the resources of our establishment to endeavour to follow our distinguished townsman through the smoothlyflowing periods of his polished and highlyornate address suffice it to observe that it was a masterpiece of eloquence and that those passages in which he more particularly traced his own successful career to its source and warned the younger portion of his auditory from the shoals of ever incurring pecuniary liabilities which they were unable to liquidate brought a tear into the manliest eye present the remaining toasts were doctor mell mrs micawber who gracefully bowed her acknowledgements from the sidedoor where a galaxy of beauty was elevated on chairs at once to witness and adorn the gratifying scene mrs ridger begs late miss micawber mrs mell wilkins micawber esquire junior who convulsed the assembly by humorously remarking that he found himself unable to return thanks in a speech but would do so with their permission in a song mrs micawber’s family well known it is needless to remark in the mothercountry c c c at the conclusion of the proceedings the tables were cleared as if by artmagic for dancing among the votaries of terpsichore who disported themselves until sol gave warning for departure wilkins micawber esquire junior and the lovely and accomplished miss helena fourth daughter of doctor mell were particularly remarkable’ i was looking back to the name of doctor mell pleased to have discovered in these happier circumstances mr mell formerly poor pinched usher to my middlesex magistrate when mr peggotty pointing to another part of the paper my eyes rested on my own name and i read thus ‘to david copperfield esquire ‘the eminent author ‘my dear sir ‘years have elapsed since i had an opportunity of ocularly perusing the lineaments now familiar to the imaginations of a considerable portion of the civilized world ‘but my dear sir though estranged by the force of circumstances over which i have had no control from the personal society of the friend and companion of my youth i have not been unmindful of his soaring flight nor have i been debarred though seas between us braid ha’ roared burns from participating in the intellectual feasts he has spread before us ‘i cannot therefore allow of the departure from this place of an individual whom we mutually respect and esteem without my dear sir taking this public opportunity of thanking you on my own behalf and i may undertake to add on that of the whole of the inhabitants of port middlebay for the gratification of which you are the ministering agent ‘go on my dear sir you are not unknown here you are not unappreciated though “remote” we are neither “unfriended” “melancholy” nor i may add “slow” go on my dear sir in your eagle course the inhabitants of port middlebay may at least aspire to watch it with delight with entertainment with instruction ‘among the eyes elevated towards you from this portion of the globe will ever be found while it has light and life ‘the ‘eye ‘appertaining to ‘wilkins micawber ‘magistrate’ i found on glancing at the remaining contents of the newspaper that mr micawber was a diligent and esteemed correspondent of that journal there was another letter from him in the same paper touching a bridge there was an advertisement of a collection of similar letters by him to be shortly republished in a neat volume ‘with considerable additions’ and unless i am very much mistaken the leading article was his also we talked much of mr micawber on many other evenings while mr peggotty remained with us he lived with us during the whole term of his staywhich i think was something less than a monthand his sister and my aunt came to london to see him agnes and i parted from him aboardship when he sailed and we shall never part from him more on earth but before he left he went with me to yarmouth to see a little tablet i had put up in the churchyard to the memory of ham while i was copying the plain inscription for him at his request i saw him stoop and gather a tuft of grass from the grave and a little earth ‘for them’ly’ he said as he put it in his breast ‘i promised mas’r davy’
