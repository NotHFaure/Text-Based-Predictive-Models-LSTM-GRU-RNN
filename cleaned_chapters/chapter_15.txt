i make another beginning mr dick and i soon became the best of friends and very often when his day’s work was done went out together to fly the great kite every day of his life he had a long sitting at the memorial which never made the least progress however hard he laboured for king charles the first always strayed into it sooner or later and then it was thrown aside and another one begun the patience and hope with which he bore these perpetual disappointments the mild perception he had that there was something wrong about king charles the first the feeble efforts he made to keep him out and the certainty with which he came in and tumbled the memorial out of all shape made a deep impression on me what mr dick supposed would come of the memorial if it were completed where he thought it was to go or what he thought it was to do he knew no more than anybody else i believe nor was it at all necessary that he should trouble himself with such questions for if anything were certain under the sun it was certain that the memorial never would be finished it was quite an affecting sight i used to think to see him with the kite when it was up a great height in the air what he had told me in his room about his belief in its disseminating the statements pasted on it which were nothing but old leaves of abortive memorials might have been a fancy with him sometimes but not when he was out looking up at the kite in the sky and feeling it pull and tug at his hand he never looked so serene as he did then i used to fancy as i sat by him of an evening on a green slope and saw him watch the kite high in the quiet air that it lifted his mind out of its confusion and bore it such was my boyish thought into the skies as he wound the string in and it came lower and lower down out of the beautiful light until it fluttered to the ground and lay there like a dead thing he seemed to wake gradually out of a dream and i remember to have seen him take it up and look about him in a lost way as if they had both come down together so that i pitied him with all my heart while i advanced in friendship and intimacy with mr dick i did not go backward in the favour of his staunch friend my aunt she took so kindly to me that in the course of a few weeks she shortened my adopted name of trotwood into trot and even encouraged me to hope that if i went on as i had begun i might take equal rank in her affections with my sister betsey trotwood ‘trot’ said my aunt one evening when the backgammonboard was placed as usual for herself and mr dick ‘we must not forget your education’ this was my only subject of anxiety and i felt quite delighted by her referring to it ‘should you like to go to school at canterbury’ said my aunt i replied that i should like it very much as it was so near her ‘good’ said my aunt ‘should you like to go tomorrow’ being already no stranger to the general rapidity of my aunt’s evolutions i was not surprised by the suddenness of the proposal and said ‘yes’ ‘good’ said my aunt again ‘janet hire the grey pony and chaise tomorrow morning at ten of the clock and pack up master trotwood’s clothes tonight’ i was greatly elated by these orders but my heart smote me for my selfishness when i witnessed their effect on mr dick who was so lowspirited at the prospect of our separation and played so ill in consequence that my aunt after giving him several admonitory raps on the knuckles with her dicebox shut up the board and declined to play with him any more but on hearing from my aunt that i should sometimes come over on a saturday and that he could sometimes come and see me on a wednesday he revived and vowed to make another kite for those occasions of proportions greatly surpassing the present one in the morning he was downhearted again and would have sustained himself by giving me all the money he had in his possession gold and silver too if my aunt had not interposed and limited the gift to five shillings which at his earnest petition were afterwards increased to ten we parted at the gardengate in a most affectionate manner and mr dick did not go into the house until my aunt had driven me out of sight of it my aunt who was perfectly indifferent to public opinion drove the grey pony through dover in a masterly manner sitting high and stiff like a state coachman keeping a steady eye upon him wherever he went and making a point of not letting him have his own way in any respect when we came into the country road she permitted him to relax a little however and looking at me down in a valley of cushion by her side asked me whether i was happy ‘very happy indeed thank you aunt’ i said she was much gratified and both her hands being occupied patted me on the head with her whip ‘is it a large school aunt’ i asked ‘why i do not know’ said my aunt ‘we are going to mr wickfield’s first’ ‘does he keep a school’ i asked ‘no trot’ said my aunt ‘he keeps an office’ i asked for no more information about mr wickfield as she offered none and we conversed on other subjects until we came to canterbury where as it was marketday my aunt had a great opportunity of insinuating the grey pony among carts baskets vegetables and huckster’s goods the hairbreadth turns and twists we made drew down upon us a variety of speeches from the people standing about which were not always complimentary but my aunt drove on with perfect indifference and i dare say would have taken her own way with as much coolness through an enemy’s country at length we stopped before a very old house bulging out over the road a house with long low latticewindows bulging out still farther and beams with carved heads on the ends bulging out too so that i fancied the whole house was leaning forward trying to see who was passing on the narrow pavement below it was quite spotless in its cleanliness the oldfashioned brass knocker on the low arched door ornamented with carved garlands of fruit and flowers twinkled like a star the two stone steps descending to the door were as white as if they had been covered with fair linen and all the angles and corners and carvings and mouldings and quaint little panes of glass and quainter little windows though as old as the hills were as pure as any snow that ever fell upon the hills when the ponychaise stopped at the door and my eyes were intent upon the house i saw a cadaverous face appear at a small window on the ground floor in a little round tower that formed one side of the house and quickly disappear the low arched door then opened and the face came out it was quite as cadaverous as it had looked in the window though in the grain of it there was that tinge of red which is sometimes to be observed in the skins of redhaired people it belonged to a redhaired persona youth of fifteen as i take it now but looking much olderwhose hair was cropped as close as the closest stubble who had hardly any eyebrows and no eyelashes and eyes of a redbrown so unsheltered and unshaded that i remember wondering how he went to sleep he was highshouldered and bony dressed in decent black with a white wisp of a neckcloth buttoned up to the throat and had a long lank skeleton hand which particularly attracted my attention as he stood at the pony’s head rubbing his chin with it and looking up at us in the chaise ‘is mr wickfield at home uriah heep’ said my aunt ‘mr wickfield’s at home madam’ said uriah heep ‘if you will please to walk in there’pointing with his long hand to the room he meant we got out and leaving him to hold the pony went into a long low parlour looking towards the street from the window of which i caught a glimpse as i went in of uriah heep breathing into the pony’s nostrils and immediately covering them with his hand as if he were putting some spell upon him opposite to the tall old chimneypiece were two portraits one of a gentleman with grey hair though not by any means an old man and black eyebrows who was looking over some papers tied together with red tape the other of a lady with a very placid and sweet expression of face who was looking at me i believe i was turning about in search of uriah’s picture when a door at the farther end of the room opening a gentleman entered at sight of whom i turned to the firstmentioned portrait again to make quite sure that it had not come out of its frame but it was stationary and as the gentleman advanced into the light i saw that he was some years older than when he had had his picture painted ‘miss betsey trotwood’ said the gentleman ‘pray walk in i was engaged for a moment but you will excuse my being busy you know my motive i have but one in life’ miss betsey thanked him and we went into his room which was furnished as an office with books papers tin boxes and so forth it looked into a garden and had an iron safe let into the wall so immediately over the mantelshelf that i wondered as i sat down how the sweeps got round it when they swept the chimney ‘well miss trotwood’ said mr wickfield for i soon found that it was he and that he was a lawyer and steward of the estates of a rich gentleman of the county ‘what wind blows you here not an ill wind i hope’ ‘no’ replied my aunt ‘i have not come for any law’ ‘that is right madam’ said mr wickfield ‘you had better come for anything else’ his hair was quite white now though his eyebrows were still black he had a very agreeable face and i thought was handsome there was a certain richness in his complexion which i had been long accustomed under peggotty’s tuition to connect with port wine and i fancied it was in his voice too and referred his growing corpulency to the same because he was very cleanly dressed in a blue coat striped waistcoat and nankeen trousers and his fine frilled shirt and cambric neckcloth looked unusually soft and white reminding my strolling fancy i call to mind of the plumage on the breast of a swan ‘this is my nephew’ said my aunt ‘was not aware you had one miss trotwood’ said mr wickfield ‘my grandnephew that is to say’ observed my aunt ‘was not aware you had a grandnephew i give you my word’ said mr wickfield ‘i have adopted him’ said my aunt with a wave of her hand importing that his knowledge and his ignorance were all one to her ‘and i have brought him here to put to a school where he may be thoroughly well taught and well treated now tell me where that school is and what it is and all about it’ ‘before i can advise you properly’ said mr wickfield‘the old question you know what is your motive in this’ ‘deuce take the man’ exclaimed my aunt ‘always fishing for motives when they are on the surface why to make the child happy and useful’ ‘it must be a mixed motive i think’ said mr wickfield shaking his head and smiling incredulously ‘a mixed fiddlestick’ returned my aunt ‘you claim to have one plain motive in all you do yourself you do not suppose i hope that you are the only plain dealer in the world’ ‘ay but i have only one motive in life miss trotwood’ he rejoined smiling ‘other people have dozens scores hundreds i have only one there is the difference however that is beside the question the best school whatever the motive you want the best’ my aunt nodded assent ‘at the best we have’ said mr wickfield considering ‘your nephew could not board just now’ ‘but he could board somewhere else i suppose’ suggested my aunt mr wickfield thought i could after a little discussion he proposed to take my aunt to the school that she might see it and judge for herself also to take her with the same object to two or three houses where he thought i could be boarded my aunt embracing the proposal we were all three going out together when he stopped and said ‘our little friend here might have some motive perhaps for objecting to the arrangements i think we had better leave him behind’ my aunt seemed disposed to contest the point but to facilitate matters i said i would gladly remain behind if they pleased and returned into mr wickfield’s office where i sat down again in the chair i had first occupied to await their return it so happened that this chair was opposite a narrow passage which ended in the little circular room where i had seen uriah heep’s pale face looking out of the window uriah having taken the pony to a neighbouring stable was at work at a desk in this room which had a brass frame on the top to hang paper upon and on which the writing he was making a copy of was then hanging though his face was towards me i thought for some time the writing being between us that he could not see me but looking that way more attentively it made me uncomfortable to observe that every now and then his sleepless eyes would come below the writing like two red suns and stealthily stare at me for i dare say a whole minute at a time during which his pen went or pretended to go as cleverly as ever i made several attempts to get out of their waysuch as standing on a chair to look at a map on the other side of the room and poring over the columns of a kentish newspaperbut they always attracted me back again and whenever i looked towards those two red suns i was sure to find them either just rising or just setting at length much to my relief my aunt and mr wickfield came back after a pretty long absence they were not so successful as i could have wished for though the advantages of the school were undeniable my aunt had not approved of any of the boardinghouses proposed for me ‘it is very unfortunate’ said my aunt ‘i do not know what to do trot’ ‘it does happen unfortunately’ said mr wickfield ‘but i will tell you what you can do miss trotwood’ ‘what is that’ inquired my aunt ‘leave your nephew here for the present he is a quiet fellow he will not disturb me at all it is a capital house for study as quiet as a monastery and almost as roomy leave him here’ my aunt evidently liked the offer though she was delicate of accepting it so did i ‘come miss trotwood’ said mr wickfield ‘this is the way out of the difficulty it is only a temporary arrangement you know if it do not act well or do not quite accord with our mutual convenience he can easily go to the rightabout there will be time to find some better place for him in the meanwhile you had better determine to leave him here for the present’ ‘i am very much obliged to you’ said my aunt ‘and so is he i see but’ ‘come i know what you mean’ cried mr wickfield ‘you shall not be oppressed by the receipt of favours miss trotwood you may pay for him if you like we will not be hard about terms but you shall pay if you will’ ‘on that understanding’ said my aunt ‘though it does not lessen the real obligation i shall be very glad to leave him’ ‘then come and see my little housekeeper’ said mr wickfield we accordingly went up a wonderful old staircase with a balustrade so broad that we might have gone up that almost as easily and into a shady old drawingroom lighted by some three or four of the quaint windows i had looked up at from the street which had old oak seats in them that seemed to have come of the same trees as the shining oak floor and the great beams in the ceiling it was a prettily furnished room with a piano and some lively furniture in red and green and some flowers it seemed to be all old nooks and corners and in every nook and corner there was some queer little table or cupboard or bookcase or seat or something or other that made me think there was not such another good corner in the room until i looked at the next one and found it equal to it if not better on everything there was the same air of retirement and cleanliness that marked the house outside mr wickfield tapped at a door in a corner of the panelled wall and a girl of about my own age came quickly out and kissed him on her face i saw immediately the placid and sweet expression of the lady whose picture had looked at me downstairs it seemed to my imagination as if the portrait had grown womanly and the original remained a child although her face was quite bright and happy there was a tranquillity about it and about hera quiet good calm spiritthat i never have forgotten that i shall never forget this was his little housekeeper his daughter agnes mr wickfield said when i heard how he said it and saw how he held her hand i guessed what the one motive of his life was she had a little baskettrifle hanging at her side with keys in it and she looked as staid and as discreet a housekeeper as the old house could have she listened to her father as he told her about me with a pleasant face and when he had concluded proposed to my aunt that we should go upstairs and see my room we all went together she before us and a glorious old room it was with more oak beams and diamond panes and the broad balustrade going all the way up to it i cannot call to mind where or when in my childhood i had seen a stained glass window in a church nor do i recollect its subject but i know that when i saw her turn round in the grave light of the old staircase and wait for us above i thought of that window and i associated something of its tranquil brightness with agnes wickfield ever afterwards my aunt was as happy as i was in the arrangement made for me and we went down to the drawingroom again well pleased and gratified as she would not hear of staying to dinner lest she should by any chance fail to arrive at home with the grey pony before dark and as i apprehend mr wickfield knew her too well to argue any point with her some lunch was provided for her there and agnes went back to her governess and mr wickfield to his office so we were left to take leave of one another without any restraint she told me that everything would be arranged for me by mr wickfield and that i should want for nothing and gave me the kindest words and the best advice ‘trot’ said my aunt in conclusion ‘be a credit to yourself to me and mr dick and heaven be with you’ i was greatly overcome and could only thank her again and again and send my love to mr dick ‘never’ said my aunt ‘be mean in anything never be false never be cruel avoid those three vices trot and i can always be hopeful of you’ i promised as well as i could that i would not abuse her kindness or forget her admonition ‘the pony’s at the door’ said my aunt ‘and i am off stay here’ with these words she embraced me hastily and went out of the room shutting the door after her at first i was startled by so abrupt a departure and almost feared i had displeased her but when i looked into the street and saw how dejectedly she got into the chaise and drove away without looking up i understood her better and did not do her that injustice by five of the clock which was mr wickfield’s dinnerhour i had mustered up my spirits again and was ready for my knife and fork the cloth was only laid for us two but agnes was waiting in the drawingroom before dinner went down with her father and sat opposite to him at table i doubted whether he could have dined without her we did not stay there after dinner but came upstairs into the drawingroom again in one snug corner of which agnes set glasses for her father and a decanter of port wine i thought he would have missed its usual flavour if it had been put there for him by any other hands there he sat taking his wine and taking a good deal of it for two hours while agnes played on the piano worked and talked to him and me he was for the most part gay and cheerful with us but sometimes his eyes rested on her and he fell into a brooding state and was silent she always observed this quickly i thought and always roused him with a question or caress then he came out of his meditation and drank more wine agnes made the tea and presided over it and the time passed away after it as after dinner until she went to bed when her father took her in his arms and kissed her and she being gone ordered candles in his office then i went to bed too but in the course of the evening i had rambled down to the door and a little way along the street that i might have another peep at the old houses and the grey cathedral and might think of my coming through that old city on my journey and of my passing the very house i lived in without knowing it as i came back i saw uriah heep shutting up the office and feeling friendly towards everybody went in and spoke to him and at parting gave him my hand but oh what a clammy hand his was as ghostly to the touch as to the sight i rubbed mine afterwards to warm it and to rub his off it was such an uncomfortable hand that when i went to my room it was still cold and wet upon my memory leaning out of the window and seeing one of the faces on the beamends looking at me sideways i fancied it was uriah heep got up there somehow and shut him out in a hurry
