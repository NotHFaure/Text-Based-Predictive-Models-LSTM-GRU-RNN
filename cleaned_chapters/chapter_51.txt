the beginning of a longer journey it was yet early in the morning of the following day when as i was walking in my garden with my aunt who took little other exercise now being so much in attendance on my dear dora i was told that mr peggotty desired to speak with me he came into the garden to meet me halfway on my going towards the gate and bared his head as it was always his custom to do when he saw my aunt for whom he had a high respect i had been telling her all that had happened overnight without saying a word she walked up with a cordial face shook hands with him and patted him on the arm it was so expressively done that she had no need to say a word mr peggotty understood her quite as well as if she had said a thousand ‘i will go in now trot’ said my aunt ‘and look after little blossom who will be getting up presently’ ‘not along of my being heer madam i hope’ said mr peggotty ‘unless my wits is gone a bahd’s neezing’by which mr peggotty meant to say bird’snesting‘this morning ‘it is along of me as you are agoing to quit us’ ‘you have something to say my good friend’ returned my aunt ‘and will do better without me’ ‘by your leave madam’ returned mr peggotty ‘i should take it kind pervising you doen’t mind my clicketten if you would bide heer’ ‘would you’ said my aunt with short goodnature ‘then i am sure i will’ so she drew her arm through mr peggotty’s and walked with him to a leafy little summerhouse there was at the bottom of the garden where she sat down on a bench and i beside her there was a seat for mr peggotty too but he preferred to stand leaning his hand on the small rustic table as he stood looking at his cap for a little while before beginning to speak i could not help observing what power and force of character his sinewy hand expressed and what a good and trusty companion it was to his honest brow and irongrey hair ‘i took my dear child away last night’ mr peggotty began as he raised his eyes to ours ‘to my lodging wheer i have a long time been expecting of her and preparing fur her it was hours afore she knowed me right and when she did she kneeled down at my feet and kiender said to me as if it was her prayers how it all come to be you may believe me when i heerd her voice as i had heerd at home so playfuland see her humbled as it might be in the dust our saviour wrote in with his blessed handi felt a wownd go to my ‘art in the midst of all its thankfulness’ he drew his sleeve across his face without any pretence of concealing why and then cleared his voice ‘it warn’t for long as i felt that for she was found i had on’y to think as she was found and it was gone i doen’t know why i do so much as mention of it now i am sure i did not have it in my mind a minute ago to say a word about myself but it come up so nat’ral that i yielded to it afore i was aweer’ ‘you are a selfdenying soul’ said my aunt ‘and will have your reward’ mr peggotty with the shadows of the leaves playing athwart his face made a surprised inclination of the head towards my aunt as an acknowledgement of her good opinion then took up the thread he had relinquished ‘when my them’ly took flight’ he said in stern wrath for the moment ‘from the house wheer she was made a prisoner by that theer spotted snake as mas’r davy seeand his story’s trew and may god confound himshe took flight in the night it was a dark night with a many stars ashining she was wild she ran along the sea beach believing the old boat was theer and calling out to us to turn away our faces for she was acoming by she heerd herself acrying out like as if it was another person and cut herself on them sharppinted stones and rocks and felt it no more than if she had been rock herself ever so fur she run and there was fire afore her eyes and roarings in her ears of a suddenor so she thowt you unnerstandthe day broke wet and windy and she was lying b’low a heap of stone upon the shore and a woman was aspeaking to her saying in the language of that country what was it as had gone so much amiss’ he saw everything he related it passed before him as he spoke so vividly that in the intensity of his earnestness he presented what he described to me with greater distinctness than i can express i can hardly believe writing now long afterwards but that i was actually present in these scenes they are impressed upon me with such an astonishing air of fidelity ‘as them’ly’s eyeswhich was heavysee this woman better’ mr peggotty went on ‘she know’d as she was one of them as she had often talked to on the beach fur though she had run as i have said ever so fur in the night she had oftentimes wandered long ways partly afoot partly in boats and carriages and know’d all that country ‘long the coast miles and miles she had not no children of her own this woman being a young wife but she was alooking to have one afore long and may my prayers go up to heaven that ‘twill be a happiness to her and a comfort and a honour all her life may it love her and be dootiful to her in her old age helpful of her at the last a angel to her heer and heerafter’ ‘amen’ said my aunt ‘she had been summat timorous and down’ said mr peggotty ‘and had sat at first a little way off at her spinning or such work as it was when them’ly talked to the children but them’ly had took notice of her and had gone and spoke to her and as the young woman was partial to the children herself they had soon made friends sermuchser that when them’ly went that way she always giv them’ly flowers this was her as now asked what it was that had gone so much amiss them’ly told her and shetook her home she did indeed she took her home’ said mr peggotty covering his face he was more affected by this act of kindness than i had ever seen him affected by anything since the night she went away my aunt and i did not attempt to disturb him ‘it was a little cottage you may suppose’ he said presently ‘but she found space for them’ly in ither husband was away at seaand she kep it secret and prevailed upon such neighbours as she had they was not many near to keep it secret too them’ly was took bad with fever and what is very strange to me ismaybe ‘it is not so strange to scholarsthe language of that country went out of her head and she could only speak her own that no one unnerstood she recollects as if she had dreamed it that she lay there always atalking her own tongue always believing as the old boat was round the next pint in the bay and begging and imploring of ‘them to send theer and tell how she was dying and bring back a message of forgiveness if it was on’y a wured a’most the whole time she thowtnow that him as i made mention on just now was lurking for her unnerneath the winder now that him as had brought her to this was in the roomand cried to the good young woman not to give her up and know’d at the same time that she could not unnerstand and dreaded that she must be took away likewise the fire was afore her eyes and the roarings in her ears and theer was no today nor yesterday nor yet tomorrow but everything in her life as ever had been or as ever could be and everything as never had been and as never could be was a crowding on her all at once and nothing clear nor welcome and yet she sang and laughed about it how long this lasted i doen’t know but then theer come a sleep and in that sleep from being a many times stronger than her own self she fell into the weakness of the littlest child’ here he stopped as if for relief from the terrors of his own description after being silent for a few moments he pursued his story ‘it was a pleasant arternoon when she awoke and so quiet that there warn’t a sound but the rippling of that blue sea without a tide upon the shore it was her belief at first that she was at home upon a sunday morning but the vine leaves as she see at the winder and the hills beyond warn’t home and contradicted of her then come in her friend to watch alongside of her bed and then she know’d as the old boat warn’t round that next pint in the bay no more but was fur off and know’d where she was and why and broke out acrying on that good young woman’s bosom wheer i hope her baby is alying now acheering of her with its pretty eyes’ he could not speak of this good friend of emily’s without a flow of tears it was in vain to try he broke down again endeavouring to bless her ‘that done my them’ly good’ he resumed after such emotion as i could not behold without sharing in and as to my aunt she wept with all her heart ‘that done them’ly good and she begun to mend but the language of that country was quite gone from her and she was forced to make signs so she went on getting better from day to day slow but sure and trying to learn the names of common thingsnames as she seemed never to have heerd in all her lifetill one evening come when she was asetting at her window looking at a little girl at play upon the beach and of a sudden this child held out her hand and said what would be in english “fisherman’s daughter here is a she will”for you are to unnerstand that they used at first to call her “pretty lady” as the general way in that country is and that she had taught ‘them to call her “fisherman’s daughter” instead the child says of a sudden “fisherman’s daughter here is a she will” then them’ly unnerstands her and she answers bursting out acrying and it all comes back ‘when them’ly got strong again’ said mr peggotty after another short interval of silence ‘she cast about to leave that good young creetur and get to her own country the husband was come home then and the two together put her aboard a small trader bound to leghorn and from that to france she had a little money but it was less than little as they would take for all they done i am a’most glad on it though they was so poor what they done is laid up wheer neither moth or rust doth corrupt and wheer thieves do not break through nor steal mas’r davy it will outlast all the treasure in the wureld ‘them’ly got to france and took service to wait on travelling ladies at a inn in the port theer theer come one day that snake let him never come nigh me i doen’t know what hurt i might do himsoon as she see him without him seeing her all her fear and wildness returned upon her and she fled afore the very breath he draw’d she come to england and was set ashore at dover ‘i doen’t know’ said mr peggotty ‘for sure when her ‘art begun to fail her but all the way to england she had thowt to come to her dear home soon as she got to england she turned her face tow’rds it but fear of not being forgiv fear of being pinted at fear of some of us being dead along of her fear of many things turned her from it kiender by force upon the road “uncle uncle” she says to me “the fear of not being worthy to do what my torn and bleeding breast so longed to do was the most fright’ning fear of all i turned back when my ‘art was full of prayers that i might crawl to the old doorstep in the night kiss it lay my wicked face upon it and theer be found dead in the morning” ‘she come’ said mr peggotty dropping his voice to an awestricken whisper ‘to london sheas had never seen it in her lifealonewithout a pennyyoungso prettycome to london a’most the moment as she lighted heer all so desolate she found as she believed a friend a decent woman as spoke to her about the needlework as she had been brought up to do about finding plenty of it fur her about a lodging fur the night and making secret inquiration concerning of me and all at home tomorrow when my child’ he said aloud and with an energy of gratitude that shook him from head to foot ‘stood upon the brink of more than i can say or think onmartha trew to her promise saved her’ i could not repress a cry of joy ‘mas’r davy’ said he gripping my hand in that strong hand of his ‘it was you as first made mention of her to me i thankee sir she was arnest she had know’d of her bitter knowledge wheer to watch and what to do she had done it and the lord was above all she come white and hurried upon them’ly in her sleep she says to her “rise up from worse than death and come with me” them belonging to the house would have stopped her but they might as soon have stopped the sea “stand away from me” she says “i am a ghost that calls her from beside her open grave” she told them’ly she had seen me and know’d i loved her and forgive her she wrapped her hasty in her clothes she took her faint and trembling on her arm she heeded no more what they said than if she had had no ears she walked among ‘them with my child minding only her and brought her safe out in the dead of the night from that black pit of ruin ‘she attended on them’ly’ said mr peggotty who had released my hand and put his own hand on his heaving chest ‘she attended to my them’ly lying wearied out and wandering betwixt whiles till late next day then she went in search of me then in search of you mas’r davy she did not tell them’ly what she come out fur lest her ‘art should fail and she should think of hiding of herself how the cruel lady know’d of her being theer i cannot say whether him as i have spoke so much of chanced to see ‘them going theer or whether which is most like to my thinking he had heerd it from the woman i doen’t greatly ask myself my niece is found ‘all night long’ said mr peggotty ‘we have been together them’ly and me ‘it is little considering the time as she has said in wureds through them brokenhearted tears ‘it is less as i have seen of her dear face as grow’d into a woman’s at my hearth but all night long her arms has been about my neck and her head has laid heer and we knows full well as we can put our trust in one another ever more’ he ceased to speak and his hand upon the table rested there in perfect repose with a resolution in it that might have conquered lions ‘it was a gleam of light upon me trot’ said my aunt drying her eyes ‘when i formed the resolution of being godmother to your sister betsey trotwood who disappointed me but next to that hardly anything would have given me greater pleasure than to be godmother to that good young creature’s baby’ mr peggotty nodded his understanding of my aunt’s feelings but could not trust himself with any verbal reference to the subject of her commendation we all remained silent and occupied with our own reflections my aunt drying her eyes and now sobbing convulsively and now laughing and calling herself a fool until i spoke ‘you have quite made up your mind’ said i to mr peggotty ‘as to the future good friend i need scarcely ask you’ ‘quite mas’r davy’ he returned ‘and told them’ly theer’s mighty countries fur from heer our future life lays over the sea’ ‘they will emigrate together aunt’ said i ‘yes’ said mr peggotty with a hopeful smile ‘no one cannot reproach my darling in australia we will begin a new life over theer’ i asked him if he yet proposed to himself any time for going away ‘i was down at the docks early this morning sir’ he returned ‘to get information concerning of them ships in about six weeks or two months from now there will be one sailingi see her this morningwent aboardand we shall take our passage in her’ ‘quite alone’ i asked ‘aye mas’r davy’ he returned ‘my sister you see she is that fond of you and yourn and that accustomed to think on’y of her own country that it would not be hardly fair to let her go besides which theer’s one she has in charge mas’r davy as doen’t ought to be forgot’ ‘poor ham’ said i ‘my good sister takes care of his house you see madam and he takes kindly to her’ mr peggotty explained for my aunt’s better information ‘he will set and talk to her with a calm spirit wen it is like he could not bring himself to open his lips to another poor fellow’ said mr peggotty shaking his head ‘theer’s not so much left him that he could spare the little as he has’ ‘and mrs gummidge’ said i ‘well i have had a mort of consideration i do tell you’ returned mr peggotty with a perplexed look which gradually cleared as he went on ‘concerning of missis gummidge you see wen missis gummidge falls athinking of the old ‘un she an’t what you may call good company betwixt you and me mas’r davyand you madamwen mrs gummidge takes to wimicking’our old country word for crying‘she is liable to be considered to be by them as did not know the old ‘un peevishlike now i did know the old ‘un’ said mr peggotty ‘and i know’d his merits so i unnerstan’ her but ‘tan’t entirely so you see with othersnat’rally cannot be’ my aunt and i both acquiesced ‘wheerby’ said mr peggotty ‘my sister mighti doen’t say she would but mightfind missis gummidge give her a leetle trouble nowandagain theerfur ‘tan’t my intentions to moor missis gummidge ‘long with them but to find a beein’ fur her wheer she can fisherate for herself’ a beein’ signifies in that dialect a home and to fisherate is to provide ‘fur which purpose’ said mr peggotty ‘i means to make her a ‘lowance afore i go as’ll leave her pretty comfort’ble she is the faithfullest of creeturs ‘tan’t to be expected of course at her time of life and being lone and lorn as the good old mawther is to be knocked about aboardship and in the woods and wilds of a new and furaway country so that is what i am agoing to do with her’ he forgot nobody he thought of everybody’s claims and strivings but his own ‘them’ly’ he continued ‘will keep along with mepoor child she is sore in need of peace and restuntil such time as we goes upon our voyage she will work at them clothes as must be made and i hope her troubles will begin to seem longer ago than they was wen she finds herself once more by her rough but loving uncle’ my aunt nodded confirmation of this hope and imparted great satisfaction to mr peggotty ‘theer’s one thing furder mas’r davy’ said he putting his hand in his breastpocket and gravely taking out the little paper bundle i had seen before which he unrolled on the table ‘theer’s these here banknotesfifty pound and ten to them i wish to add the money as she come away with i have asked her about that but not saying why and have added of it up i an’t a scholar would you be so kind as see how ‘it is’ he handed me apologetically for his scholarship a piece of paper and observed me while i looked it over it was quite right ‘thankee sir’ he said taking it back ‘this money if you doen’t see objections mas’r davy i shall put up jest afore i go in a cover directed to him and put that up in another directed to his mother i shall tell her in no more wureds than i speak to you what it is the price on and that i am gone and past receiving of it back’ i told him that i thought it would be right to do sothat i was thoroughly convinced it would be since he felt it to be right ‘i said that theer was on’y one thing furder’ he proceeded with a grave smile when he had made up his little bundle again and put it in his pocket ‘but theer was two i warn’t sure in my mind wen i come out this morning as i could go and break to ham of my own self what had so thankfully happened so i writ a letter while i was out and put it in the postoffice telling of ‘them how all was as ‘it is and that i should come down tomorrow to unload my mind of what little needs adoing of down theer and mostlike take my farewell leave of yarmouth’ ‘and do you wish me to go with you’ said i seeing that he left something unsaid ‘if you could do me that kind favour mas’r davy’ he replied ‘i know the sight on you would cheer ‘them up a bit’ my little dora being in good spirits and very desirous that i should goas i found on talking it over with heri readily pledged myself to accompany him in accordance with his wish next morning consequently we were on the yarmouth coach and again travelling over the old ground as we passed along the familiar street at nightmr peggotty in despite of all my remonstrances carrying my bagi glanced into omer and joram’s shop and saw my old friend mr omer there smoking his pipe i felt reluctant to be present when mr peggotty first met his sister and ham and made mr omer my excuse for lingering behind ‘how is mr omer after this long time’ said i going in he fanned away the smoke of his pipe that he might get a better view of me and soon recognized me with great delight ‘i should get up sir to acknowledge such an honour as this visit’ said he ‘only my limbs are rather out of sorts and i am wheeled about with the exception of my limbs and my breath howsoever i am as hearty as a man can be i am thankful to say’ i congratulated him on his contented looks and his good spirits and saw now that his easychair went on wheels ‘it is an ingenious thing are not it’ he inquired following the direction of my glance and polishing the elbow with his arm ‘it runs as light as a feather and tracks as true as a mailcoach bless you my little minniemy granddaughter you know minnie’s childputs her little strength against the back gives it a shove and away we go as clever and merry as ever you see anything and i tell you whatit is a most uncommon chair to smoke a pipe in’ i never saw such a good old fellow to make the best of a thing and find out the enjoyment of it as mr omer he was as radiant as if his chair his asthma and the failure of his limbs were the various branches of a great invention for enhancing the luxury of a pipe ‘i see more of the world i can assure you’ said mr omer ‘in this chair than ever i see out of it you would be surprised at the number of people that looks in of a day to have a chat you really would there is twice as much in the newspaper since i have taken to this chair as there used to be as to general reading dear me what a lot of it i do get through that is what i feel so strong you know if it had been my eyes what should i have done if it had been my ears what should i have done being my limbs what does it signify why my limbs only made my breath shorter when i used ‘them and now if i want to go out into the street or down to the sands i have only got to call dick joram’s youngest ‘prentice and away i go in my own carriage like the lord mayor of london’ he half suffocated himself with laughing here ‘lord bless you’ said mr omer resuming his pipe ‘a man must take the fat with the lean that is what he must make up his mind to in this life joram does a fine business excellent business’ ‘i am very glad to hear it’ said i ‘i knew you would be’ said mr omer ‘and joram and minnie are like valentines what more can a man expect what is his limbs to that’ his supreme contempt for his own limbs as he sat smoking was one of the pleasantest oddities i have ever encountered ‘and since i have took to general reading you have took to general writing eh sir’ said mr omer surveying me admiringly ‘what a lovely work that was of yours what expressions in it i read it every wordevery word and as to feeling sleepy not at all’ i laughingly expressed my satisfaction but i must confess that i thought this association of ideas significant ‘i give you my word and honour sir’ said mr omer ‘that when i lay that book upon the table and look at it outside compact in three separate and indiwidual wollumesone two three i am as proud as punch to think that i once had the honour of being connected with your family and dear me it is a long time ago now are not it over at blunderstone with a pretty little party laid along with the other party and you quite a small party then yourself dear dear’ i changed the subject by referring to emily after assuring him that i did not forget how interested he had always been in her and how kindly he had always treated her i gave him a general account of her restoration to her uncle by the aid of martha which i knew would please the old man he listened with the utmost attention and said feelingly when i had done ‘i am rejoiced at it sir it is the best news i have heard for many a day dear dear dear and what is going to be undertook for that unfortunate young woman martha now’ ‘you touch a point that my thoughts have been dwelling on since yesterday’ said i ‘but on which i can give you no information yet mr omer mr peggotty has not alluded to it and i have a delicacy in doing so i am sure he has not forgotten it he forgets nothing that is disinterested and good’ ‘because you know’ said mr omer taking himself up where he had left off ‘whatever is done i should wish to be a member of put me down for anything you may consider right and let me know i never could think the girl all bad and i am glad to find she is not so will my daughter minnie be young women are contradictory creatures in some thingsher mother was just the same as herbut their hearts are soft and kind it is all show with minnie about martha why she should consider it necessary to make any show i do not undertake to tell you but it is all show bless you she would do her any kindness in private so put me down for whatever you may consider right will you be so good and drop me a line where to forward it dear me’ said mr omer ‘when a man is drawing on to a time of life where the two ends of life meet when he finds himself however hearty he is being wheeled about for the second time in a speeches of gocart he should be overrejoiced to do a kindness if he can he wants plenty and i do not speak of myself particular’ said mr omer ‘because sir the way i look at it is that we are all drawing on to the bottom of the hill whatever age we are on account of time never standing still for a single moment so let us always do a kindness and be overrejoiced to be sure’ he knocked the ashes out of his pipe and put it on a ledge in the back of his chair expressly made for its reception ‘there is them’ly’s cousin him that she was to have been married to’ said mr omer rubbing his hands feebly ‘as fine a fellow as there is in yarmouth he will come and talk or read to me in the evening for an hour together sometimes that is a kindness i should call it all his life’s a kindness’ ‘i am going to see him now’ said i ‘are you’ said mr omer ‘tell him i was hearty and sent my respects minnie and joram’s at a ball they would be as proud to see you as i am if they was at home minnie will not hardly go out at all you see “on account of father” as she says so i swore tonight that if she did not go i would go to bed at six in consequence of which’ mr omer shook himself and his chair with laughter at the success of his device ‘she and joram’s at a ball’ i shook hands with him and wished him good night ‘half a minute sir’ said mr omer ‘if you was to go without seeing my little elephant you would lose the best of sights you never see such a sight minnie’ a musical little voice answered from somewhere upstairs ‘i am coming grandfather’ and a pretty little girl with long flaxen curling hair soon came running into the shop ‘this is my little elephant sir’ said mr omer fondling the child ‘siamese breed sir now little elephant’ the little elephant set the door of the parlour open enabling me to see that in these latter days it was converted into a bedroom for mr omer who could not be easily conveyed upstairs and then hid her pretty forehead and tumbled her long hair against the back of mr omer’s chair ‘the elephant butts you know sir’ said mr omer winking ‘when he goes at a object once elephant twice three times’ at this signal the little elephant with a dexterity that was next to marvellous in so small an animal whisked the chair round with mr omer in it and rattled it off pellmell into the parlour without touching the doorpost mr omer indescribably enjoying the performance and looking back at me on the road as if it were the triumphant issue of his life’s exertions after a stroll about the town i went to ham’s house peggotty had now removed here for good and had let her own house to the successor of mr barkis in the carrying business who had paid her very well for the goodwill cart and horse i believe the very same slow horse that mr barkis drove was still at work i found them in the neat kitchen accompanied by mrs gummidge who had been fetched from the old boat by mr peggotty himself i doubt if she could have been induced to desert her post by anyone else he had evidently told them all both peggotty and mrs gummidge had their aprons to their eyes and ham had just stepped out ‘to take a turn on the beach’ he presently came home very glad to see me and i hope they were all the better for my being there we spoke with some approach to cheerfulness of mr peggotty’s growing rich in a new country and of the wonders he would describe in his letters we said nothing of emily by name but distantly referred to her more than once ham was the serenest of the party but peggotty told me when she lighted me to a little chamber where the crocodile book was lying ready for me on the table that he always was the same she believed she told me crying that he was brokenhearted though he was as full of courage as of sweetness and worked harder and better than any boatbuilder in any yard in all that part there were times she said of an evening when he talked of their old life in the boathouse and then he mentioned emily as a child but he never mentioned her as a woman i thought i had read in his face that he would like to speak to me alone i therefore resolved to put myself in his way next evening as he came home from his work having settled this with myself i fell asleep that night for the first time in all those many nights the candle was taken out of the window mr peggotty swung in his old hammock in the old boat and the wind murmured with the old sound round his head all next day he was occupied in disposing of his fishingboat and tackle in packing up and sending to london by waggon such of his little domestic possessions as he thought would be useful to him and in parting with the rest or bestowing them on mrs gummidge she was with him all day as i had a sorrowful wish to see the old place once more before it was locked up i engaged to meet them there in the evening but i so arranged it as that i should meet ham first it was easy to come in his way as i knew where he worked i met him at a retired part of the sands which i knew he would cross and turned back with him that he might have leisure to speak to me if he really wished i had not mistaken the expression of his face we had walked but a little way together when he said without looking at me ‘mas’r davy have you seen her’ ‘only for a moment when she was in a swoon’ i softly answered we walked a little farther and he said ‘mas’r davy shall you see her d’ye think’ ‘it would be too painful to her perhaps’ said i ‘i have thowt of that’ he replied ‘so ‘twould sir so ‘twould’ ‘but ham’ said i gently ‘if there is anything that i could write to her for you in case i could not tell it if there is anything you would wish to make known to her through me i should consider it a sacred trust’ ‘i am sure on’t i thankee sir most kind i think theer is something i could wish said or wrote’ ‘what is it’ we walked a little farther in silence and then he spoke ‘’tan’t that i forgive her ‘tan’t that so much ‘it is more as i beg of her to forgive me for having pressed my affections upon her odd times i think that if i had not had her promise fur to marry me sir she was that trustful of me in a friendly way that she would have told me what was struggling in her mind and would have counselled with me and i might have saved her’ i pressed his hand ‘is that all’ ‘theer’s yet a something else’ he returned ‘if i can say it mas’r davy’ we walked on farther than we had walked yet before he spoke again he was not crying when he made the pauses i shall express by lines he was merely collecting himself to speak very plainly ‘i loved herand i love the mem’ry of hertoo deepto be able to lead her to believe of my own self as i am a happy man i could only be happyby forgetting of herand i am afeerd i could not hardly bear as she should be told i done that but if you being so full of learning mas’r davy could think of anything to say as might bring her to believe i was not greatly hurt still loving of her and mourning for her anything as might bring her to believe as i was not tired of my life and yet was hoping fur to see her without blame wheer the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at restanything as would ease her sorrowful mind and yet not make her think as i could ever marry or as ‘it was possible that anyone could ever be to me what she wasi should ask of you to say thatwith my prayers for herthat was so dear’ i pressed his manly hand again and told him i would charge myself to do this as well as i could ‘i thankee sir’ he answered ‘it was kind of you to meet me ‘it was kind of you to bear him company down mas’r davy i unnerstan’ very well though my aunt will come to lon’on afore they sail and they will unite once more that i am not like to see him agen i fare to feel sure on’t we doen’t say so but so ‘twill be and better so the last you see on himthe very lastwill you give him the lovingest duty and thanks of the orphan as he was ever more than a father to’ this i also promised faithfully ‘i thankee agen sir’ he said heartily shaking hands ‘i know wheer you are agoing goodbye’ with a slight wave of his hand as though to explain to me that he could not enter the old place he turned away as i looked after his figure crossing the waste in the moonlight i saw him turn his face towards a strip of silvery light upon the sea and pass on looking at it until he was a shadow in the distance the door of the boathouse stood open when i approached and on entering i found it emptied of all its furniture saving one of the old lockers on which mrs gummidge with a basket on her knee was seated looking at mr peggotty he leaned his elbow on the rough chimneypiece and gazed upon a few expiring embers in the grate but he raised his head hopefully on my coming in and spoke in a cheery manner ‘come according to promise to bid farewell to ‘t eh mas’r davy’ he said taking up the candle ‘bare enough now an’t it’ ‘indeed you have made good use of the time’ said i ‘why we have not been idle sir missis gummidge has worked like ai doen’t know what missis gummidge an’t worked like’ said mr peggotty looking at her at a loss for a sufficiently approving simile mrs gummidge leaning on her basket made no observation ‘theer’s the very locker that you used to sit on ‘long with them’ly’ said mr peggotty in a whisper ‘i am agoing to carry it away with me last of all and heer’s your old little bedroom see mas’r davy a’most as bleak tonight as ‘art could wish’ in truth the wind though it was low had a solemn sound and crept around the deserted house with a whispered wailing that was very mournful everything was gone down to the little mirror with the oystershe will frame i thought of myself lying here when that first great change was being wrought at home i thought of the blueeyed child who had enchanted me i thought of steerforth and a foolish fearful fancy came upon me of his being near at hand and liable to be met at any turn ‘it is like to be long’ said mr peggotty in a low voice ‘afore the boat finds new tenants they look upon ‘t down heer as being unfortunate now’ ‘does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood’ i asked ‘to a mastmaker up town’ said mr peggotty ‘i am agoing to give the key to him tonight’ we looked into the other little room and came back to mrs gummidge sitting on the locker whom mr peggotty putting the light on the chimneypiece requested to rise that he might carry it outside the door before extinguishing the candle ‘dan’l’ said mrs gummidge suddenly deserting her basket and clinging to his arm ‘my dear dan’l the parting words i speak in this house is i must not be left behind doen’t ye think of leaving me behind dan’l oh doen’t ye ever do it’ mr peggotty taken aback looked from mrs gummidge to me and from me to mrs gummidge as if he had been awakened from a sleep ‘doen’t ye dearest dan’l doen’t ye’ cried mrs gummidge fervently ‘take me ‘long with you dan’l take me ‘long with you and them’ly i will be your servant constant and trew if there is slaves in them parts where you are agoing i will be bound to you for one and happy but doen’t ye leave me behind dan’l that is a deary dear’ ‘my good soul’ said mr peggotty shaking his head ‘you doen’t know what a long voyage and what a hard life ‘it is’ ‘yes i do dan’l i can guess’ cried mrs gummidge ‘but my parting words under this roof is i shall go into the house and die if i am not took i can dig dan’l i can work i can live hard i can be loving and patient nowmore than you think dan’l if you will on’y try me i would not touch the ‘lowance not if i was dying of want dan’l peggotty but i will go with you and them’ly if you will on’y let me to the world’s end i know how ‘it is i know you think that i am lone and lorn but deary love ‘tan’t so no more i are not sat here so long awatching and athinking of your trials without some good being done me mas’r davy speak to him for me i knows his ways and them’ly’s and i knows their sorrows and can be a comfort to ‘them some odd times and labour for ‘them allus dan’l deary dan’l let me go ‘long with you’ and mrs gummidge took his hand and kissed it with a homely pathos and affection in a homely rapture of devotion and gratitude that he well deserved we brought the locker out extinguished the candle fastened the door on the outside and left the old boat close shut up a dark speck in the cloudy night next day when we were returning to london outside the coach mrs gummidge and her basket were on the seat behind and mrs gummidge was happy
