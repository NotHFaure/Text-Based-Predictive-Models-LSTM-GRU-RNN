dora’s aunts at last an answer came from the two old ladies they presented their compliments to mr copperfield and informed him that they had given his letter their best consideration ‘with a view to the happiness of both parties’which i thought rather an alarming expression not only because of the use they had made of it in relation to the family difference beforementioned but because i had and have all my life observed that conventional phrases are a sort of fireworks easily let off and liable to take a great variety of shapes and colours not at all suggested by their original form the misses spenlow added that they begged to forbear expressing ‘through the medium of correspondence’ an opinion on the subject of mr copperfield’s communication but that if mr copperfield would do them the favour to call upon a certain day accompanied if he thought proper by a confidential friend they would be happy to hold some conversation on the subject to this favour mr copperfield immediately replied with his respectful compliments that he would have the honour of waiting on the misses spenlow at the time appointed accompanied in accordance with their kind permission by his friend mr thomas traddles of the inner temple having dispatched which missive mr copperfield fell into a condition of strong nervous agitation and so remained until the day arrived it was a great augmentation of my uneasiness to be bereaved at this eventful crisis of the inestimable services of miss mills but mr mills who was always doing something or other to annoy meor i felt as if he were which was the same thinghad brought his conduct to a climax by taking it into his head that he would go to india why should he go to india except to harass me to be sure he had nothing to do with any other part of the world and had a good deal to do with that part being entirely in the india trade whatever that was i had floating dreams myself concerning golden shawls and elephants’ teeth having been at calcutta in his youth and designing now to go out there again in the capacity of resident partner but this was nothing to me however it was so much to him that for india he was bound and julia with him and julia went into the country to take leave of her relations and the house was put into a perfect suit of bills announcing that it was to be let or sold and that the furniture mangle and all was to be taken at a valuation so here was another earthquake of which i became the sport before i had recovered from the shock of its predecessor i was in several minds how to dress myself on the important day being divided between my desire to appear to advantage and my apprehensions of putting on anything that might impair my severely practical character in the eyes of the misses spenlow i endeavoured to hit a happy medium between these two extremes my aunt approved the result and mr dick threw one of his shoes after traddles and me for luck as we went downstairs excellent fellow as i knew traddles to be and warmly attached to him as i was i could not help wishing on that delicate occasion that he had never contracted the habit of brushing his hair so very upright it gave him a surprised looknot to say a hearthbroomy kind of expressionwhich my apprehensions whispered might be fatal to us i took the liberty of mentioning it to traddles as we were walking to putney and saying that if he would smooth it down a little ‘my dear copperfield’ said traddles lifting off his hat and rubbing his hair all kinds of ways ‘nothing would give me greater pleasure but it will not’ ‘will not be smoothed down’ said i ‘no’ said traddles ‘nothing will induce it if i was to carry a halfhundredweight upon it all the way to putney it would be up again the moment the weight was taken off you have no idea what obstinate hair mine is copperfield i am quite a fretful porcupine’ i was a little disappointed i must confess but thoroughly charmed by his goodnature too i told him how i esteemed his goodnature and said that his hair must have taken all the obstinacy out of his character for he had none ‘oh’ returned traddles laughing ‘i assure you it is quite an old story my unfortunate hair my uncle’s wife could not bear it she said it exasperated her it stood very much in my way too when i first fell in love with sophy very much’ ‘did she object to it’ ‘she did not’ rejoined traddles ‘but her eldest sisterthe one that is the beautyquite made game of it i understand in fact all the sisters laugh at it’ ‘agreeable’ said i ‘yes’ returned traddles with perfect innocence ‘it is a joke for us they pretend that sophy has a lock of it in her desk and is obliged to shut it in a clasped book to keep it down we laugh about it’ ‘by the by my dear traddles’ said i ‘your experience may suggest something to me when you became engaged to the young lady whom you have just mentioned did you make a regular proposal to her family was there anything likewhat we are going through today for instance’ i added nervously ‘why’ replied traddles on whose attentive face a thoughtful shade had stolen ‘it was rather a painful transaction copperfield in my case you see sophy being of so much use in the family none of them could endure the thought of her ever being married indeed they had quite settled among themselves that she never was to be married and they called her the old maid accordingly when i mentioned it with the greatest precaution to mrs crewler’ ‘the mama’ said i ‘the mama’ said traddles‘reverend horace crewlerwhen i mentioned it with every possible precaution to mrs crewler the effect upon her was such that she gave a scream and became insensible i could not approach the subject again for months’ ‘you did at last’ said i ‘well the reverend horace did’ said traddles ‘he is an excellent man most exemplary in every way and he pointed out to her that she ought as a christian to reconcile herself to the sacrifice especially as it was so uncertain and to bear no uncharitable feeling towards me as to myself copperfield i give you my word i felt a perfect bird of prey towards the family’ ‘the sisters took your part i hope traddles’ ‘why i cannot say they did’ he returned ‘when we had comparatively reconciled mrs crewler to it we had to break it to sarah you recollect my mentioning sarah as the one that has something the matter with her spine’ ‘perfectly’ ‘she clenched both her hands’ said traddles looking at me in dismay ‘shut her eyes turned leadcolour became perfectly stiff and took nothing for two days but toastandwater administered with a teaspoon’ ‘what a very unpleasant girl traddles’ i remarked ‘oh i beg your pardon copperfield’ said traddles ‘she is a very charming girl but she has a great deal of feeling in fact they all have sophy told me afterwards that the selfreproach she underwent while she was in attendance upon sarah no words could describe i know it must have been severe by my own feelings copperfield which were like a criminal’s after sarah was restored we still had to break it to the other eight and it produced various effects upon them of a most pathetic nature the two little ones whom sophy educates have only just left off detesting me’ ‘at any rate they are all reconciled to it now i hope’ said i ‘yeyes i should say they were on the whole resigned to it’ said traddles doubtfully ‘the fact is we avoid mentioning the subject and my unsettled prospects and indifferent circumstances are a great consolation to them there will be a deplorable scene whenever we are married it will be much more like a funeral than a wedding and they will all hate me for taking her away’ his honest face as he looked at me with a seriocomic shake of his head impresses me more in the remembrance than it did in the reality for i was by this time in a state of such excessive trepidation and wandering of mind as to be quite unable to fix my attention on anything on our approaching the house where the misses spenlow lived i was at such a discount in respect of my personal looks and presence of mind that traddles proposed a gentle stimulant in the form of a glass of ale this having been administered at a neighbouring publichouse he conducted me with tottering steps to the misses spenlow’s door i had a vague sensation of being as it were on view when the maid opened it and of wavering somehow across a hall with a weatherglass in it into a quiet little drawingroom on the groundfloor commanding a neat garden also of sitting down here on a sofa and seeing traddles’s hair start up now his hat was removed like one of those obtrusive little figures made of springs that fly out of fictitious snuffboxes when the lid is taken off also of hearing an oldfashioned clock ticking away on the chimneypiece and trying to make it keep time to the jerking of my heartwhich it would not also of looking round the room for any sign of dora and seeing none also of thinking that jip once barked in the distance and was instantly choked by somebody ultimately i found myself backing traddles into the fireplace and bowing in great confusion to two dry little elderly ladies dressed in black and each looking wonderfully like a preparation in chip or tan of the late mr spenlow ‘pray’ said one of the two little ladies ‘be seated’ when i had done tumbling over traddles and had sat upon something which was not a catmy first seat wasi so far recovered my sight as to perceive that mr spenlow had evidently been the youngest of the family that there was a disparity of six or eight years between the two sisters and that the younger appeared to be the manager of the conference inasmuch as she had my letter in her handso familiar as it looked to me and yet so oddand was referring to it through an eyeglass they were dressed alike but this sister wore her dress with a more youthful air than the other and perhaps had a trifle more frill or tucker or brooch or bracelet or some little thing of that kind which made her look more lively they were both upright in their carriage formal precise composed and quiet the sister who had not my letter had her arms crossed on her breast and resting on each other like an idol ‘mr copperfield i believe’ said the sister who had got my letter addressing herself to traddles this was a frightful beginning traddles had to indicate that i was mr copperfield and i had to lay claim to myself and they had to divest themselves of a preconceived opinion that traddles was mr copperfield and altogether we were in a nice condition to improve it we all distinctly heard jip give two short barks and receive another choke ‘mr copperfield’ said the sister with the letter i did somethingbowed i supposeand was all attention when the other sister struck in ‘my sister lavinia’ said she ‘being conversant with matters of this nature will state what we consider most calculated to promote the happiness of both parties’ i discovered afterwards that miss lavinia was an authority in affairs of the heart by reason of there having anciently existed a certain mr pidger who played short whist and was supposed to have been enamoured of her my private opinion is that this was entirely a gratuitous assumption and that pidger was altogether innocent of any such sentimentsto which he had never given any sort of expression that i could ever hear of both miss lavinia and miss clarissa had a superstition however that he would have declared his passion if he had not been cut short in his youth at about sixty by overdrinking his constitution and overdoing an attempt to set it right again by swilling bath water they had a lurking suspicion even that he died of secret love though i must say there was a picture of him in the house with a damask nose which concealment did not appear to have ever preyed upon ‘we will not’ said miss lavinia ‘enter on the past history of this matter our poor brother francis’s death has cancelled that’ ‘we had not’ said miss clarissa ‘been in the habit of frequent association with our brother francis but there was no decided division or disunion between us francis took his road we took ours we considered it conducive to the happiness of all parties that it should be so and it was so’ each of the sisters leaned a little forward to speak shook her head after speaking and became upright again when silent miss clarissa never moved her arms she sometimes played tunes upon them with her fingersminuets and marches i should thinkbut never moved them ‘our niece’s position or supposed position is much changed by our brother francis’s death’ said miss lavinia ‘and therefore we consider our brother’s opinions as regarded her position as being changed too we have no reason to doubt mr copperfield that you are a young gentleman possessed of good qualities and honourable character or that you have an affectionor are fully persuaded that you have an affectionfor our niece’ i replied as i usually did whenever i had a chance that nobody had ever loved anybody else as i loved dora traddles came to my assistance with a confirmatory murmur miss lavinia was going on to make some rejoinder when miss clarissa who appeared to be incessantly beset by a desire to refer to her brother francis struck in again ‘if dora’s mama’ she said ‘when she married our brother francis had at once said that there was not room for the family at the dinnertable it would have been better for the happiness of all parties’ ‘sister clarissa’ said miss lavinia ‘perhaps we need not mind that now’ ‘sister lavinia’ said miss clarissa ‘it belongs to the subject with your branch of the subject on which alone you are competent to speak i should not think of interfering on this branch of the subject i have a voice and an opinion it would have been better for the happiness of all parties if dora’s mama when she married our brother francis had mentioned plainly what her intentions were we should then have known what we had to expect we should have said “pray do not invite us at any time” and all possibility of misunderstanding would have been avoided’ when miss clarissa had shaken her head miss lavinia resumed again referring to my letter through her eyeglass they both had little bright round twinkling eyes by the way which were like birds’ eyes they were not unlike birds altogether having a sharp brisk sudden manner and a little short spruce way of adjusting themselves like canaries miss lavinia as i have said resumed ‘you ask permission of my sister clarissa and myself mr copperfield to visit here as the accepted suitor of our niece’ ‘if our brother francis’ said miss clarissa breaking out again if i may call anything so calm a breaking out ‘wished to surround himself with an atmosphere of doctors’ commons and of doctors’ commons only what right or desire had we to object none i am sure we have ever been far from wishing to obtrude ourselves on anyone but why not say so let our brother francis and his wife have their society let my sister lavinia and myself have our society we can find it for ourselves i hope’ as this appeared to be addressed to traddles and me both traddles and i made some sort of reply traddles was inaudible i think i observed myself that it was highly creditable to all concerned i do not in the least know what i meant ‘sister lavinia’ said miss clarissa having now relieved her mind ‘you can go on my dear’ miss lavinia proceeded ‘mr copperfield my sister clarissa and i have been very careful indeed in considering this letter and we have not considered it without finally showing it to our niece and discussing it with our niece we have no doubt that you think you like her very much’ ‘think madam’ i rapturously began ‘oh’ but miss clarissa giving me a look just like a sharp canary as requesting that i would not interrupt the oracle i begged pardon ‘affection’ said miss lavinia glancing at her sister for corroboration which she gave in the form of a little nod to every clause ‘mature affection homage devotion does not easily express itself its voice is low it is modest and retiring it lies in ambush waits and waits such is the mature fruit sometimes a life glides away and finds it still ripening in the shade’ of course i did not understand then that this was an allusion to her supposed experience of the stricken pidger but i saw from the gravity with which miss clarissa nodded her head that great weight was attached to these words ‘the lightfor i call them in comparison with such sentiments the lightinclinations of very young people’ pursued miss lavinia ‘are dust compared to rocks it is owing to the difficulty of knowing whether they are likely to endure or have any real foundation that my sister clarissa and myself have been very undecided how to act mr copperfield and mr’ ‘traddles’ said my friend finding himself looked at ‘i beg pardon of the inner temple i believe’ said miss clarissa again glancing at my letter traddles said ‘exactly so’ and became pretty red in the face now although i had not received any express encouragement as yet i fancied that i saw in the two little sisters and particularly in miss lavinia an intensified enjoyment of this new and fruitful subject of domestic interest a settling down to make the most of it a disposition to pet it in which there was a good bright ray of hope i thought i perceived that miss lavinia would have uncommon satisfaction in superintending two young lovers like dora and me and that miss clarissa would have hardly less satisfaction in seeing her superintend us and in chiming in with her own particular department of the subject whenever that impulse was strong upon her this gave me courage to protest most vehemently that i loved dora better than i could tell or anyone believe that all my friends knew how i loved her that my aunt agnes traddles everyone who knew me knew how i loved her and how earnest my love had made me for the truth of this i appealed to traddles and traddles firing up as if he were plunging into a parliamentary debate really did come out nobly confirming me in good round terms and in a plain sensible practical manner that evidently made a favourable impression ‘i speak if i may presume to say so as one who has some little experience of such things’ said traddles ‘being myself engaged to a young ladyone of ten down in devonshireand seeing no probability at present of our engagement coming to a termination’ ‘you may be able to confirm what i have said mr traddles’ observed miss lavinia evidently taking a new interest in him ‘of the affection that is modest and retiring that waits and waits’ ‘entirely madam’ said traddles miss clarissa looked at miss lavinia and shook her head gravely miss lavinia looked consciously at miss clarissa and heaved a little sigh ‘sister lavinia’ said miss clarissa ‘take my smellingbottle’ miss lavinia revived herself with a few whiffs of aromatic vinegartraddles and i looking on with great solicitude the while and then went on to say rather faintly ‘my sister and myself have been in great doubt mr traddles what course we ought to take in reference to the likings or imaginary likings of such very young people as your friend mr copperfield and our niece’ ‘our brother francis’s child’ remarked miss clarissa ‘if our brother francis’s wife had found it convenient in her lifetime though she had an unquestionable right to act as she thought best to invite the family to her dinnertable we might have known our brother francis’s child better at the present moment sister lavinia proceed’ miss lavinia turned my letter so as to bring the superscription towards herself and referred through her eyeglass to some orderlylooking notes she had made on that part of it ‘it seems to us’ said she ‘prudent mr traddles to bring these feelings to the test of our own observation at present we know nothing of them and are not in a situation to judge how much reality there may be in them therefore we are inclined so far to accede to mr copperfield’s proposal as to admit his visits here’ ‘i shall never dear ladies’ i exclaimed relieved of an immense load of apprehension ‘forget your kindness’ ‘but’ pursued miss lavinia‘but we would prefer to regard those visits mr traddles as made at present to us we must guard ourselves from recognizing any positive engagement between mr copperfield and our niece until we have had an opportunity’ ‘until you have had an opportunity sister lavinia’ said miss clarissa ‘be it so’ assented miss lavinia with a sigh‘until i have had an opportunity of observing them’ ‘copperfield’ said traddles turning to me ‘you feel i am sure that nothing could be more reasonable or considerate’ ‘nothing’ cried i ‘i am deeply sensible of it’ ‘in this position of affairs’ said miss lavinia again referring to her notes ‘and admitting his visits on this understanding only we must require from mr copperfield a distinct assurance on his word of honour that no communication of any kind shall take place between him and our niece without our knowledge that no project whatever shall be entertained with regard to our niece without being first submitted to us’ ‘to you sister lavinia’ miss clarissa interposed ‘be it so clarissa’ assented miss lavinia resignedly‘to meand receiving our concurrence we must make this a most express and serious stipulation not to be broken on any account we wished mr copperfield to be accompanied by some confidential friend today’ with an inclination of her head towards traddles who bowed ‘in order that there might be no doubt or misconception on this subject if mr copperfield or if you mr traddles feel the least scruple in giving this promise i beg you to take time to consider it’ i exclaimed in a state of high ecstatic fervour that not a moment’s consideration could be necessary i bound myself by the required promise in a most impassioned manner called upon traddles to witness it and denounced myself as the most atrocious of characters if i ever swerved from it in the least degree ‘stay’ said miss lavinia holding up her hand ‘we resolved before we had the pleasure of receiving you two gentlemen to leave you alone for a quarter of an hour to consider this point you will allow us to retire’ it was in vain for me to say that no consideration was necessary they persisted in withdrawing for the specified time accordingly these little birds hopped out with great dignity leaving me to receive the congratulations of traddles and to feel as if i were translated to regions of exquisite happiness exactly at the expiration of the quarter of an hour they reappeared with no less dignity than they had disappeared they had gone rustling away as if their little dresses were made of autumnleaves and they came rustling back in like manner i then bound myself once more to the prescribed conditions ‘sister clarissa’ said miss lavinia ‘the rest is with you’ miss clarissa unfolding her arms for the first time took the notes and glanced at them ‘we shall be happy’ said miss clarissa ‘to see mr copperfield to dinner every sunday if it should suit his convenience our hour is three’ i bowed ‘in the course of the week’ said miss clarissa ‘we shall be happy to see mr copperfield to tea our hour is halfpast six’ i bowed again ‘twice in the week’ said miss clarissa ‘but as a rule not oftener’ i bowed again ‘miss trotwood’ said miss clarissa ‘mentioned in mr copperfield’s letter will perhaps call upon us when visiting is better for the happiness of all parties we are glad to receive visits and return them when it is better for the happiness of all parties that no visiting should take place as in the case of our brother francis and his establishment that is quite different’ i intimated that my aunt would be proud and delighted to make their acquaintance though i must say i was not quite sure of their getting on very satisfactorily together the conditions being now closed i expressed my acknowledgements in the warmest manner and taking the hand first of miss clarissa and then of miss lavinia pressed it in each case to my lips miss lavinia then arose and begging mr traddles to excuse us for a minute requested me to follow her i obeyed all in a tremble and was conducted into another room there i found my blessed darling stopping her ears behind the door with her dear little face against the wall and jip in the platewarmer with his head tied up in a towel oh how beautiful she was in her black frock and how she sobbed and cried at first and would not come out from behind the door how fond we were of one another when she did come out at last and what a state of bliss i was in when we took jip out of the platewarmer and restored him to the light sneezing very much and were all three reunited ‘my dearest dora now indeed my own for ever’ ‘oh do not’ pleaded dora ‘please’ ‘are you not my own for ever dora’ ‘oh yes of course i am’ cried dora ‘but i am so frightened’ ‘frightened my own’ ‘oh yes i do not like him’ said dora ‘why do not he go’ ‘who my life’ ‘your friend’ said dora ‘it is not any business of his what a stupid he must be’ ‘my love’ there never was anything so coaxing as her childish ways ‘he is the best creature’ ‘oh but we do not want any best creatures’ pouted dora ‘my dear’ i argued ‘you will soon know him well and like him of all things and here is my aunt coming soon and you will like her of all things too when you know her’ ‘no please do not bring her’ said dora giving me a horrified little kiss and folding her hands ‘do not i know she is a naughty mischiefmaking old thing do not let her come here doady’ which was a corruption of david remonstrance was of no use then so i laughed and admired and was very much in love and very happy and she showed me jip’s new trick of standing on his hind legs in a cornerwhich he did for about the space of a flash of lightning and then fell downand i do not know how long i should have stayed there oblivious of traddles if miss lavinia had not come in to take me away miss lavinia was very fond of dora she told me dora was exactly like what she had been herself at her ageshe must have altered a good deal and she treated dora just as if she had been a toy i wanted to persuade dora to come and see traddles but on my proposing it she ran off to her own room and locked herself in so i went to traddles without her and walked away with him on air ‘nothing could be more satisfactory’ said traddles ‘and they are very agreeable old ladies i am sure i should not be at all surprised if you were to be married years before me copperfield’ ‘does your sophy play on any instrument traddles’ i inquired in the pride of my heart ‘she knows enough of the piano to teach it to her little sisters’ said traddles ‘does she sing at all’ i asked ‘why she sings ballads sometimes to freshen up the others a little when they are out of spirits’ said traddles ‘nothing scientific’ ‘she does not sing to the guitar’ said i ‘oh dear no’ said traddles ‘paint at all’ ‘not at all’ said traddles i promised traddles that he should hear dora sing and see some of her flowerpainting he said he should like it very much and we went home arm in arm in great good humour and delight i encouraged him to talk about sophy on the way which he did with a loving reliance on her that i very much admired i compared her in my mind with dora with considerable inward satisfaction but i candidly admitted to myself that she seemed to be an excellent kind of girl for traddles too of course my aunt was immediately made acquainted with the successful issue of the conference and with all that had been said and done in the course of it she was happy to see me so happy and promised to call on dora’s aunts without loss of time but she took such a long walk up and down our rooms that night while i was writing to agnes that i began to think she meant to walk till morning my letter to agnes was a fervent and grateful one narrating all the good effects that had resulted from my following her advice she wrote by return of post to me her letter was hopeful earnest and cheerful she was always cheerful from that time i had my hands more full than ever now my daily journeys to highgate considered putney was a long way off and i naturally wanted to go there as often as i could the proposed teadrinkings being quite impracticable i compounded with miss lavinia for permission to visit every saturday afternoon without detriment to my privileged sundays so the close of every week was a delicious time for me and i got through the rest of the week by looking forward to it i was wonderfully relieved to find that my aunt and dora’s aunts rubbed on all things considered much more smoothly than i could have expected my aunt made her promised visit within a few days of the conference and within a few more days dora’s aunts called upon her in due state and form similar but more friendly exchanges took place afterwards usually at intervals of three or four weeks i know that my aunt distressed dora’s aunts very much by utterly setting at naught the dignity of flyconveyance and walking out to putney at extraordinary times as shortly after breakfast or just before tea likewise by wearing her bonnet in any manner that happened to be comfortable to her head without at all deferring to the prejudices of civilization on that subject but dora’s aunts soon agreed to regard my aunt as an eccentric and somewhat masculine lady with a strong understanding and although my aunt occasionally ruffled the feathers of dora’s aunts by expressing heretical opinions on various points of ceremony she loved me too well not to sacrifice some of her little peculiarities to the general harmony the only member of our small society who positively refused to adapt himself to circumstances was jip he never saw my aunt without immediately displaying every tooth in his head retiring under a chair and growling incessantly with now and then a doleful howl as if she really were too much for his feelings all kinds of treatment were tried with him coaxing scolding slapping bringing him to buckingham street where he instantly dashed at the two cats to the terror of all beholders but he never could prevail upon himself to bear my aunt’s society he would sometimes think he had got the better of his objection and be amiable for a few minutes and then would put up his snub nose and howl to that extent that there was nothing for it but to blind him and put him in the platewarmer at length dora regularly muffled him in a towel and shut him up there whenever my aunt was reported at the door one thing troubled me much after we had fallen into this quiet train it was that dora seemed by one consent to be regarded like a pretty toy or plaything my aunt with whom she gradually became familiar always called her little blossom and the pleasure of miss lavinia’s life was to wait upon her curl her hair make ornaments for her and treat her like a pet child what miss lavinia did her sister did as a matter of course it was very odd to me but they all seemed to treat dora in her degree much as dora treated jip in his i made up my mind to speak to dora about this and one day when we were out walking for we were licensed by miss lavinia after a while to go out walking by ourselves i said to her that i wished she could get them to behave towards her differently ‘because you know my darling’ i remonstrated ‘you are not a child’ ‘there’ said dora ‘now you are going to be cross’ ‘cross my love’ ‘i am sure they are very kind to me’ said dora ‘and i am very happy’ ‘well but my dearest life’ said i ‘you might be very happy and yet be treated rationally’ dora gave me a reproachful lookthe prettiest lookand then began to sob saying if i did not like her why had i ever wanted so much to be engaged to her and why did not i go away now if i could not bear her what could i do but kiss away her tears and tell her how i doted on her after that ‘i am sure i am very affectionate’ said dora ‘you ought not to be cruel to me doady’ ‘cruel my precious love as if i wouldor couldbe cruel to you for the world’ ‘then do not find fault with me’ said dora making a rosebud of her mouth ‘and i will be good’ i was charmed by her presently asking me of her own accord to give her that cookerybook i had once spoken of and to show her how to keep accounts as i had once promised i would i brought the volume with me on my next visit i got it prettily bound first to make it look less dry and more inviting and as we strolled about the common i showed her an old housekeepingbook of my aunt’s and gave her a set of tablets and a pretty little pencilcase and box of leads to practise housekeeping with but the cookerybook made dora’s head ache and the figures made her cry they would not add up she said so she rubbed them out and drew little nosegays and likenesses of me and jip all over the tablets then i playfully tried verbal instruction in domestic matters as we walked about on a saturday afternoon sometimes for example when we passed a butcher’s shop i would say ‘now suppose my pet that we were married and you were going to buy a shoulder of mutton for dinner would you know how to buy it’ my pretty little dora’s face would fall and she would make her mouth into a bud again as if she would very much prefer to shut mine with a kiss ‘would you know how to buy it my darling’ i would repeat perhaps if i were very inflexible dora would think a little and then reply perhaps with great triumph ‘why the butcher would know how to sell it and what need i know oh you silly boy’ so when i once asked dora with an eye to the cookerybook what she would do if we were married and i were to say i should like a nice irish stew she replied that she would tell the servant to make it and then clapped her little hands together across my arm and laughed in such a charming manner that she was more delightful than ever consequently the principal use to which the cookerybook was devoted was being put down in the corner for jip to stand upon but dora was so pleased when she had trained him to stand upon it without offering to come off and at the same time to hold the pencilcase in his mouth that i was very glad i had bought it and we fell back on the guitarcase and the flowerpainting and the songs about never leaving off dancing ta ra la and were as happy as the week was long i occasionally wished i could venture to hint to miss lavinia that she treated the darling of my heart a little too much like a plaything and i sometimes awoke as it were wondering to find that i had fallen into the general fault and treated her like a plaything toobut not often
