my aunt astonishes me i wrote to agnes as soon as dora and i were engaged i wrote her a long letter in which i tried to make her comprehend how blest i was and what a darling dora was i entreated agnes not to regard this as a thoughtless passion which could ever yield to any other or had the least resemblance to the boyish fancies that we used to joke about i assured her that its profundity was quite unfathomable and expressed my belief that nothing like it had ever been known somehow as i wrote to agnes on a fine evening by my open window and the remembrance of her clear calm eyes and gentle face came stealing over me it she would such a peaceful influence upon the hurry and agitation in which i had been living lately and of which my very happiness partook in some degree that it soothed me into tears i remember that i sat resting my head upon my hand when the letter was half done cherishing a general fancy as if agnes were one of the elements of my natural home as if in the retirement of the house made almost sacred to me by her presence dora and i must be happier than anywhere as if in love joy sorrow hope or disappointment in all emotions my heart turned naturally there and found its refuge and best friend of steerforth i said nothing i only told her there had been sad grief at yarmouth on account of emily’s flight and that on me it made a double wound by reason of the circumstances attending it i knew how quick she always was to divine the truth and that she would never be the first to breathe his name to this letter i received an answer by return of post as i read it i seemed to hear agnes speaking to me it was like her cordial voice in my ears what can i say more while i had been away from home lately traddles had called twice or thrice finding peggotty within and being informed by peggotty who always volunteered that information to whomsoever would receive it that she was my old nurse he had established a goodhumoured acquaintance with her and had stayed to have a little chat with her about me so peggotty said but i am afraid the chat was all on her own side and of immoderate length as she was very difficult indeed to stop god bless her when she had me for her theme this reminds me not only that i expected traddles on a certain afternoon of his own appointing which was now come but that mrs crupp had resigned everything appertaining to her office the salary excepted until peggotty should cease to present herself mrs crupp after holding divers conversations respecting peggotty in a very highpitched voice on the staircasewith some invisible familiar it would appear for corporeally speaking she was quite alone at those timesaddressed a letter to me developing her views beginning it with that statement of universal application which fitted every occurrence of her life namely that she was a mother herself she went on to inform me that she had once seen very different days but that at all periods of her existence she had had a constitutional objection to spies intruders and informers she named no names she said let them the cap fitted wear it but spies intruders and informers especially in widders’ weeds this clause was underlined she had ever accustomed herself to look down upon if a gentleman was the victim of spies intruders and informers but still naming no names that was his own pleasure he had a right to please himself so let him do all that she mrs crupp stipulated for was that she should not be ‘brought in contract’ with such persons therefore she begged to be excused from any further attendance on the top set until things were as they formerly was and as they could be wished to be and further mentioned that her little book would be found upon the breakfasttable every saturday morning when she requested an immediate settlement of the same with the benevolent view of saving trouble ‘and an illconwenience’ to all parties after this mrs crupp confined herself to making pitfalls on the stairs principally with pitchers and endeavouring to delude peggotty into breaking her legs i found it rather harassing to live in this state of siege but was too much afraid of mrs crupp to see any way out of it ‘my dear copperfield’ cried traddles punctually appearing at my door in spite of all these obstacles ‘how do you do’ ‘my dear traddles’ said i ‘i am delighted to see you at last and very sorry i have not been at home before but i have been so much engaged’ ‘yes yes i know’ said traddles ‘of course yours lives in london i think’ ‘what did you say’ ‘sheexcuse memiss d you know’ said traddles colouring in his great delicacy ‘lives in london i believe’ ‘oh yes near london’ ‘mine perhaps you recollect’ said traddles with a serious look ‘lives down in devonshireone of ten consequently i am not so much engaged as youin that sense’ ‘i wonder you can bear’ i returned ‘to see her so seldom’ ‘hah’ said traddles thoughtfully ‘it does seem a wonder i suppose it is copperfield because there is no help for it’ ‘i suppose so’ i replied with a smile and not without a blush ‘and because you have so much constancy and patience traddles’ ‘dear me’ said traddles considering about it ‘do i strike you in that way copperfield really i did not know that i had but she is such an extraordinarily dear girl herself that it is possible she may have imparted something of those virtues to me now you mention it copperfield i should not wonder at all i assure you she is always forgetting herself and taking care of the other nine’ ‘is she the eldest’ i inquired ‘oh dear no’ said traddles ‘the eldest is a beauty’ he saw i suppose that i could not help smiling at the simplicity of this reply and added with a smile upon his own ingenuous face ‘not of course but that my sophypretty name copperfield i always think’ ‘very pretty’ said i ‘not of course but that sophy is beautiful too in my eyes and would be one of the dearest girls that ever was in anybody’s eyes i should think but when i say the eldest is a beauty i mean she really is a’ he seemed to be describing clouds about himself with both hands ‘splendid you know’ said traddles energetically ‘indeed’ said i ‘oh i assure you’ said traddles ‘something very uncommon indeed then you know being formed for society and admiration and not being able to enjoy much of it in consequence of their limited means she naturally gets a little irritable and exacting sometimes sophy puts her in good humour’ ‘is sophy the youngest’ i hazarded ‘oh dear no’ said traddles stroking his chin ‘the two youngest are only nine and ten sophy educates ‘them’ ‘the second daughter perhaps’ i hazarded ‘no’ said traddles ‘sarah’s the second sarah has something the matter with her spine poor girl the malady will wear out by and by the doctors say but in the meantime she has to lie down for a twelvemonth sophy nurses her sophy’s the fourth’ ‘is the mother living’ i inquired ‘oh yes’ said traddles ‘she is alive she is a very superior woman indeed but the damp country is not adapted to her constitution andin fact she has lost the use of her limbs’ ‘dear me’ said i ‘very sad is it not’ returned traddles ‘but in a merely domestic view it is not so bad as it might be because sophy takes her place she is quite as much a mother to her mother as she is to the other nine’ i felt the greatest admiration for the virtues of this young lady and honestly with the view of doing my best to prevent the goodnature of traddles from being imposed upon to the detriment of their joint prospects in life inquired how mr micawber was ‘he is quite well copperfield thank you’ said traddles ‘i am not living with him at present’ ‘no’ ‘no you see the truth is’ said traddles in a whisper ‘he had changed his name to mortimer in consequence of his temporary embarrassments and he do not come out till after darkand then in spectacles there was an execution put into our house for rent mrs micawber was in such a dreadful state that i really could not resist giving my name to that second bill we spoke of here you may imagine how delightful it was to my feelings copperfield to see the matter settled with it and mrs micawber recover her spirits’ ‘hum’ said i ‘not that her happiness was of long duration’ pursued traddles ‘for unfortunately within a week another execution came in it broke up the establishment i have been living in a furnished apartment since then and the mortimers have been very private indeed i hope you will not think it selfish copperfield if i mention that the broker carried off my little round table with the marble top and sophy’s flowerpot and stand’ ‘what a hard thing’ i exclaimed indignantly ‘it was ait was a pull’ said traddles with his usual wince at that expression ‘i do not mention it reproachfully however but with a motive the fact is copperfield i was unable to repurchase them at the time of their seizure in the first place because the broker having an idea that i wanted them ran the price up to an extravagant extent and in the second place because ihad not any money now i have kept my eye since upon the broker’s shop’ said traddles with a great enjoyment of his mystery ‘which is up at the top of tottenham court road and at last today i find them put out for sale i have only noticed them from over the way because if the broker saw me bless you he would ask any price for them what has occurred to me having now the money is that perhaps you would not object to ask that good nurse of yours to come with me to the shopi can show it her from round the corner of the next streetand make the best bargain for them as if they were for herself that she can’ the delight with which traddles propounded this plan to me and the sense he had of its uncommon artfulness are among the freshest things in my remembrance i told him that my old nurse would be delighted to assist him and that we would all three take the field together but on one condition that condition was that he should make a solemn resolution to grant no more loans of his name or anything else to mr micawber ‘my dear copperfield’ said traddles ‘i have already done so because i begin to feel that i have not only been inconsiderate but that i have been positively unjust to sophy my word being passed to myself there is no longer any apprehension but i pledge it to you too with the greatest readiness that first unlucky obligation i have paid i have no doubt mr micawber would have paid it if he could but he could not one thing i ought to mention which i like very much in mr micawber copperfield it refers to the second obligation which is not yet due he do not tell me that it is provided for but he says it will be now i think there is something very fair and honest about that’ i was unwilling to damp my good friend’s confidence and therefore assented after a little further conversation we went round to the chandler’s shop to enlist peggotty traddles declining to pass the evening with me both because he endured the liveliest apprehensions that his property would be bought by somebody else before he could repurchase it and because it was the evening he always devoted to writing to the dearest girl in the world i never shall forget him peeping round the corner of the street in tottenham court road while peggotty was bargaining for the precious articles or his agitation when she came slowly towards us after vainly offering a price and was hailed by the relenting broker and went back again the end of the negotiation was that she bought the property on tolerably easy terms and traddles was transported with pleasure ‘i am very much obliged to you indeed’ said traddles on hearing it was to be sent to where he lived that night ‘if i might ask one other favour i hope you would not think it absurd copperfield’ i said beforehand certainly not ‘then if you would be good enough’ said traddles to peggotty ‘to get the flowerpot now i think i should like it being sophy’s copperfield to carry it home myself’ peggotty was glad to get it for him and he overwhelmed her with thanks and went his way up tottenham court road carrying the flowerpot affectionately in his arms with one of the most delighted expressions of countenance i ever saw we then turned back towards my chambers as the shops had charms for peggotty which i never knew them possess in the same degree for anybody else i sauntered easily along amused by her staring in at the windows and waiting for her as often as she chose we were thus a good while in getting to the adelphi on our way upstairs i called her attention to the sudden disappearance of mrs crupp’s pitfalls and also to the prints of recent footsteps we were both very much surprised coming higher up to find my outer door standing open which i had shut and to hear voices inside we looked at one another without knowing what to make of this and went into the sittingroom what was my amazement to find of all people upon earth my aunt there and mr dick my aunt sitting on a quantity of luggage with her two birds before her and her cat on her knee like a female robinson crusoe drinking tea mr dick leaning thoughtfully on a great kite such as we had often been out together to fly with more luggage piled about him ‘my dear aunt’ cried i ‘why what an unexpected pleasure’ we cordially embraced and mr dick and i cordially shook hands and mrs crupp who was busy making tea and could not be too attentive cordially said she had knowed well as mr copperfull would have his heart in his mouth when he see his dear relations ‘holloa’ said my aunt to peggotty who quailed before her awful presence ‘how are you’ ‘you remember my aunt peggotty’ said i ‘for the love of goodness child’ exclaimed my aunt ‘do not call the woman by that south sea island name if she married and got rid of it which was the best thing she could do why do not you give her the benefit of the change what is your name nowp’ said my aunt as a compromise for the obnoxious appellation ‘barkis madam’ said peggotty with a curtsey ‘well that is human’ said my aunt ‘it sounds less as if you wanted a missionary how d’ye do barkis i hope you are well’ encouraged by these gracious words and by my aunt’s extending her hand barkis came forward and took the hand and curtseyed her acknowledgements ‘we are older than we were i see’ said my aunt ‘we have only met each other once before you know a nice business we made of it then trot my dear another cup’ i handed it dutifully to my aunt who was in her usual inflexible state of figure and ventured a remonstrance with her on the subject of her sitting on a box ‘let me draw the sofa here or the easychair aunt’ said i ‘why should you be so uncomfortable’ ‘thank you trot’ replied my aunt ‘i prefer to sit upon my property’ here my aunt looked hard at mrs crupp and observed ‘we need not trouble you to wait madam’ ‘shall i put a little more tea in the pot afore i go madam’ said mrs crupp ‘no i thank you madam’ replied my aunt ‘would you let me fetch another pat of butter madam’ said mrs crupp ‘or would you be persuaded to try a newlaid hegg or should i brile a rasher are not there nothing i could do for your dear aunt mr copperfull’ ‘nothing madam’ returned my aunt ‘i shall do very well i thank you’ mrs crupp who had been incessantly smiling to express sweet temper and incessantly holding her head on one side to express a general feebleness of constitution and incessantly rubbing her hands to express a desire to be of service to all deserving objects gradually smiled herself onesided herself and rubbed herself out of the room ‘dick’ said my aunt ‘you know what i told you about timeservers and wealthworshippers’ mr dickwith rather a scared look as if he had forgotten itreturned a hasty answer in the affirmative ‘mrs crupp is one of them’ said my aunt ‘barkis i will trouble you to look after the tea and let me have another cup for i do not fancy that woman’s pouringout’ i knew my aunt sufficiently well to know that she had something of importance on her mind and that there was far more matter in this arrival than a stranger might have supposed i noticed how her eye lighted on me when she thought my attention otherwise occupied and what a curious process of hesitation appeared to be going on within her while she preserved her outward stiffness and composure i began to reflect whether i had done anything to offend her and my conscience whispered me that i had not yet told her about dora could it by any means be that i wondered as i knew she would only speak in her own good time i sat down near her and spoke to the birds and played with the cat and was as easy as i could be but i was very far from being really easy and i should still have been so even if mr dick leaning over the great kite behind my aunt had not taken every secret opportunity of shaking his head darkly at me and pointing at her ‘trot’ said my aunt at last when she had finished her tea and carefully smoothed down her dress and wiped her lips‘you need not go barkistrot have you got to be firm and selfreliant’ ‘i hope so aunt’ ‘what do you think’ inquired miss betsey ‘i think so aunt’ ‘then why my love’ said my aunt looking earnestly at me ‘why do you think i prefer to sit upon this property of mine tonight’ i shook my head unable to guess ‘because’ said my aunt ‘it is all i have because i am ruined my dear’ if the house and every one of us had tumbled out into the river together i could hardly have received a greater shock ‘dick knows it’ said my aunt laying her hand calmly on my shoulder ‘i am ruined my dear trot all i have in the world is in this room except the cottage and that i have left janet to let barkis i want to get a bed for this gentleman tonight to save expense perhaps you can make up something here for myself anything will do it is only for tonight we will talk about this more tomorrow’ i was roused from my amazement and concern for heri am sure for herby her falling on my neck for a moment and crying that she only grieved for me in another moment she suppressed this emotion and said with an aspect more triumphant than dejected ‘we must meet reverses boldly and not suffer them to frighten us my dear we must learn to act the play out we must live misfortune down trot’
