the sequel of my resolution for anything i know i may have had some wild idea of running all the way to dover when i gave up the pursuit of the young man with the donkeycart and started for greenwich my scattered senses were soon collected as to that point if i had for i came to a stop in the kent road at a terrace with a piece of water before it and a great foolish image in the middle blowing a dry she will here i sat down on a doorstep quite spent and exhausted with the efforts i had already made and with hardly breath enough to cry for the loss of my box and halfguinea it was by this time dark i heard the clocks strike ten as i sat resting but it was a summer night fortunately and fine weather when i had recovered my breath and had got rid of a stifling sensation in my throat i rose up and went on in the midst of my distress i had no notion of going back i doubt if i should have had any though there had been a swiss snowdrift in the kent road but my standing possessed of only threehalfpence in the world and i am sure i wonder how they came to be left in my pocket on a saturday night troubled me none the less because i went on i began to picture to myself as a scrap of newspaper intelligence my being found dead in a day or two under some hedge and i trudged on miserably though as fast as i could until i happened to pass a little shop where it was written up that ladies’ and gentlemen’s wardrobes were bought and that the best price was given for rags bones and kitchenstuff the master of this shop was sitting at the door in his shirtsleeves smoking and as there were a great many coats and pairs of trousers dangling from the low ceiling and only two feeble candles burning inside to show what they were i fancied that he looked like a man of a revengeful disposition who had hung all his enemies and was enjoying himself my late experiences with mr and mrs micawber suggested to me that here might be a means of keeping off the wolf for a little while i went up the next bystreet took off my waistcoat rolled it neatly under my arm and came back to the shop door ‘if you please sir’ i said ‘i am to sell this for a fair price’ mr dollobydolloby was the name over the shop door at leasttook the waistcoat stood his pipe on its head against the doorpost went into the shop followed by me snuffed the two candles with his fingers spread the waistcoat on the counter and looked at it there held it up against the light and looked at it there and ultimately said ‘what do you call a price now for this here little weskit’ ‘oh you know best sir’ i returned modestly ‘i cannot be buyer and seller too’ said mr dolloby ‘put a price on this here little weskit’ ‘would eighteenpence be’i hinted after some hesitation mr dolloby rolled it up again and gave it me back ‘i should rob my family’ he said ‘if i was to offer ninepence for it’ this was a disagreeable way of putting the business because it imposed upon me a perfect stranger the unpleasantness of asking mr dolloby to rob his family on my account my circumstances being so very pressing however i said i would take ninepence for it if he pleased mr dolloby not without some grumbling gave ninepence i wished him good night and walked out of the shop the richer by that sum and the poorer by a waistcoat but when i buttoned my jacket that was not much indeed i foresaw pretty clearly that my jacket would go next and that i should have to make the best of my way to dover in a shirt and a pair of trousers and might deem myself lucky if i got there even in that trim but my mind did not run so much on this as might be supposed beyond a general impression of the distance before me and of the young man with the donkeycart having used me cruelly i think i had no very urgent sense of my difficulties when i once again set off with my ninepence in my pocket a plan had occurred to me for passing the night which i was going to carry into execution this was to lie behind the wall at the back of my old school in a corner where there used to be a haystack i imagined it would be a kind of company to have the boys and the bedroom where i used to tell the stories so near me although the boys would know nothing of my being there and the bedroom would yield me no shelter i had had a hard day’s work and was pretty well jaded when i came climbing out at last upon the level of blackheath it cost me some trouble to find out salem house but i found it and i found a haystack in the corner and i lay down by it having first walked round the wall and looked up at the windows and seen that all was dark and silent within never shall i forget the lonely sensation of first lying down without a roof above my head sleep came upon me as it came on many other outcasts against whom housedoors were locked and housedogs barked that nightand i dreamed of lying on my old schoolbed talking to the boys in my room and found myself sitting upright with steerforth’s name upon my lips looking wildly at the stars that were glistening and glimmering above me when i remembered where i was at that untimely hour a feeling stole upon me that made me get up afraid of i do not know what and walk about but the fainter glimmering of the stars and the pale light in the sky where the day was coming reassured me and my eyes being very heavy i lay down again and sleptthough with a knowledge in my sleep that it was colduntil the warm beams of the sun and the ringing of the gettingup bell at salem house awoke me if i could have hoped that steerforth was there i would have lurked about until he came out alone but i knew he must have left long since traddles still remained perhaps but it was very doubtful and i had not sufficient confidence in his discretion or good luck however strong my reliance was on his good nature to wish to trust him with my situation so i crept away from the wall as mr creakle’s boys were getting up and struck into the long dusty track which i had first known to be the dover road when i was one of them and when i little expected that any eyes would ever see me the wayfarer i was now upon it what a different sunday morning from the old sunday morning at yarmouth in due time i heard the churchbells ringing as i plodded on and i met people who were going to church and i passed a church or two where the congregation were inside and the sound of singing came out into the sunshine while the beadle sat and cooled himself in the shade of the porch or stood beneath the yewtree with his hand to his forehead glowering at me going by but the peace and rest of the old sunday morning were on everything except me that was the difference i felt quite wicked in my dirt and dust with my tangled hair but for the quiet picture i had conjured up of my mother in her youth and beauty weeping by the fire and my aunt relenting to her i hardly think i should have had the courage to go on until next day but it always went before me and i followed i got that sunday through threeandtwenty miles on the straight road though not very easily for i was new to that kind of toil i see myself as evening closes in coming over the bridge at rochester footsore and tired and eating bread that i had bought for supper one or two little houses with the notice ‘lodgings for travellers’ hanging out had tempted me but i was afraid of spending the few pence i had and was even more afraid of the vicious looks of the trampers i had met or overtaken i sought no shelter therefore but the sky and toiling into chathamwhich in that night’s aspect is a mere dream of chalk and drawbridges and mastless ships in a muddy river roofed like noah’s arkscrept at last upon a sort of grassgrown battery overhanging a lane where a sentry was walking to and fro here i lay down near a cannon and happy in the society of the sentry’s footsteps though he knew no more of my being above him than the boys at salem house had known of my lying by the wall slept soundly until morning very stiff and sore of foot i was in the morning and quite dazed by the beating of drums and marching of troops which seemed to hem me in on every side when i went down towards the long narrow street feeling that i could go but a very little way that day if i were to reserve any strength for getting to my journey’s end i resolved to make the sale of my jacket its principal business accordingly i took the jacket off that i might learn to do without it and carrying it under my arm began a tour of inspection of the various slopshops it was a likely place to sell a jacket in for the dealers in secondhand clothes were numerous and were generally speaking on the lookout for customers at their shop doors but as most of them had hanging up among their stock an officer’s coat or two epaulettes and all i was rendered timid by the costly nature of their dealings and walked about for a long time without offering my merchandise to anyone this modesty of mine directed my attention to the marinestore shops and such shops as mr dolloby’s in preference to the regular dealers at last i found one that i thought looked promising at the corner of a dirty lane ending in an enclosure full of stingingnettles against the palings of which some secondhand sailors’ clothes that seemed to have overflowed the shop were fluttering among some cots and rusty guns and oilskin hats and certain trays full of so many old rusty keys of so many sizes that they seemed various enough to open all the doors in the world into this shop which was low and small and which was darkened rather than lighted by a little window overhung with clothes and was descended into by some steps i went with a palpitating heart which was not relieved when an ugly old man with the lower part of his face all covered with a stubbly grey beard rushed out of a dirty den behind it and seized me by the hair of my head he was a dreadful old man to look at in a filthy flannel waistcoat and smelling terribly of rum his bedstead covered with a tumbled and ragged piece of patchwork was in the den he had come from where another little window showed a prospect of more stingingnettles and a lame donkey ‘oh what do you want’ grinned this old man in a fierce monotonous whine ‘oh my eyes and limbs what do you want oh my lungs and liver what do you want oh goroo goroo’ i was so much dismayed by these words and particularly by the repetition of the last unknown one which was a kind of rattle in his throat that i could make no answer hereupon the old man still holding me by the hair repeated ‘oh what do you want oh my eyes and limbs what do you want oh my lungs and liver what do you want oh goroo’which he screwed out of himself with an energy that made his eyes start in his head ‘i wanted to know’ i said trembling ‘if you would buy a jacket’ ‘oh let us see the jacket’ cried the old man ‘oh my heart on fire show the jacket to us oh my eyes and limbs bring the jacket out’ with that he took his trembling hands which were like the claws of a great bird out of my hair and put on a pair of spectacles not at all ornamental to his inflamed eyes ‘oh how much for the jacket’ cried the old man after examining it ‘ohgoroohow much for the jacket’ ‘halfacrown’ i answered recovering myself ‘oh my lungs and liver’ cried the old man ‘no oh my eyes no oh my limbs no eighteenpence goroo’ every time he uttered this ejaculation his eyes seemed to be in danger of starting out and every sentence he spoke he delivered in a sort of tune always exactly the same and more like a gust of wind which begins low mounts up high and falls again than any other comparison i can find for it ‘well’ said i glad to have closed the bargain ‘i will take eighteenpence’ ‘oh my liver’ cried the old man throwing the jacket on a shelf ‘get out of the shop oh my lungs get out of the shop oh my eyes and limbsgoroodo not ask for money make it an exchange’ i never was so frightened in my life before or since but i told him humbly that i wanted money and that nothing else was of any use to me but that i would wait for it as he desired outside and had no wish to hurry him so i went outside and sat down in the shade in a corner and i sat there so many hours that the shade became sunlight and the sunlight became shade again and still i sat there waiting for the money there never was such another drunken madman in that line of business i hope that he was well known in the neighbourhood and enjoyed the reputation of having sold himself to the devil i soon understood from the visits he received from the boys who continually came skirmishing about the shop shouting that legend and calling to him to bring out his gold ‘you are not poor you know charley as you pretend bring out your gold bring out some of the gold you sold yourself to the devil for come it is in the lining of the mattress charley rip it open and let us have some’ this and many offers to lend him a knife for the purpose exasperated him to such a degree that the whole day was a succession of rushes on his part and flights on the part of the boys sometimes in his rage he would take me for one of them and come at me mouthing as if he were going to tear me in pieces then remembering me just in time would dive into the shop and lie upon his bed as i thought from the sound of his voice yelling in a frantic way to his own windy tune the ‘death of nelson’ with an oh before every line and innumerable goroos interspersed as if this were not bad enough for me the boys connecting me with the establishment on account of the patience and perseverance with which i sat outside halfdressed pelted me and used me very ill all day he made many attempts to induce me to consent to an exchange at one time coming out with a fishingrod at another with a fiddle at another with a cocked hat at another with a flute but i resisted all these overtures and sat there in desperation each time asking him with tears in my eyes for my money or my jacket at last he began to pay me in halfpence at a time and was full two hours getting by easy stages to a shilling ‘oh my eyes and limbs’ he then cried peeping hideously out of the shop after a long pause ‘will you go for twopence more’ ‘i cannot’ i said ‘i shall be starved’ ‘oh my lungs and liver will you go for threepence’ ‘i would go for nothing if i could’ i said ‘but i want the money badly’ ‘oh goroo’ it is really impossible to express how he twisted this ejaculation out of himself as he peeped round the doorpost at me showing nothing but his crafty old head ‘will you go for fourpence’ i was so faint and weary that i closed with this offer and taking the money out of his claw not without trembling went away more hungry and thirsty than i had ever been a little before sunset but at an expense of threepence i soon refreshed myself completely and being in better spirits then limped seven miles upon my road my bed at night was under another haystack where i rested comfortably after having washed my blistered feet in a stream and dressed them as well as i was able with some cool leaves when i took the road again next morning i found that it lay through a succession of hopgrounds and orchards it was sufficiently late in the year for the orchards to be ruddy with ripe apples and in a few places the hoppickers were already at work i thought it all extremely beautiful and made up my mind to sleep among the hops that night imagining some cheerful companionship in the long perspectives of poles with the graceful leaves twining round them the trampers were worse than ever that day and inspired me with a dread that is yet quite fresh in my mind some of them were most ferociouslooking ruffians who stared at me as i went by and stopped perhaps and called after me to come back and speak to them and when i took to my heels stoned me i recollect one young fellowa tinker i suppose from his wallet and brazierwho had a woman with him and who faced about and stared at me thus and then roared to me in such a tremendous voice to come back that i halted and looked round ‘come here when you are called’ said the tinker ‘or i will rip your young body open’ i thought it best to go back as i drew nearer to them trying to propitiate the tinker by my looks i observed that the woman had a black eye ‘where are you going’ said the tinker gripping the bosom of my shirt with his blackened hand ‘i am going to dover’ i said ‘where do you come from’ asked the tinker giving his hand another turn in my shirt to hold me more securely ‘i come from london’ i said ‘what lay are you upon’ asked the tinker ‘are you a prig’ ‘nno’ i said ‘are not you by g if you make a brag of your honesty to me’ said the tinker ‘i will knock your brains out’ with his disengaged hand he made a menace of striking me and then looked at me from head to foot ‘have you got the price of a pint of beer about you’ said the tinker ‘if you have out with it afore i take it away’ i should certainly have produced it but that i met the woman’s look and saw her very slightly shake her head and form ‘no’ with her lips ‘i am very poor’ i said attempting to smile ‘and have got no money’ ‘why what do you mean’ said the tinker looking so sternly at me that i almost feared he saw the money in my pocket ‘sir’ i stammered ‘what do you mean’ said the tinker ‘by wearing my brother’s silk handkerchief give it over here’ and he had mine off my neck in a moment and tossed it to the woman the woman burst into a fit of laughter as if she thought this a joke and tossed it back to me nodded once as slightly as before and made the word ‘go’ with her lips before i could obey however the tinker seized the handkerchief out of my hand with a roughness that threw me away like a feather and putting it loosely round his own neck turned upon the woman with an oath and knocked her down i never shall forget seeing her fall backward on the hard road and lie there with her bonnet tumbled off and her hair all whitened in the dust nor when i looked back from a distance seeing her sitting on the pathway which was a bank by the roadside wiping the blood from her face with a corner of her shawl while he went on ahead this adventure frightened me so that afterwards when i saw any of these people coming i turned back until i could find a hidingplace where i remained until they had gone out of sight which happened so often that i was very seriously delayed but under this difficulty as under all the other difficulties of my journey i seemed to be sustained and led on by my fanciful picture of my mother in her youth before i came into the world it always kept me company it was there among the hops when i lay down to sleep it was with me on my waking in the morning it went before me all day i have associated it ever since with the sunny street of canterbury dozing as it were in the hot light and with the sight of its old houses and gateways and the stately grey cathedral with the rooks sailing round the towers when i came at last upon the bare wide downs near dover it relieved the solitary aspect of the scene with hope and not until i reached that first great aim of my journey and actually set foot in the town itself on the sixth day of my flight did it desert me but then strange to say when i stood with my ragged shoes and my dusty sunburnt halfclothed figure in the place so long desired it seemed to vanish like a dream and to leave me helpless and dispirited i inquired about my aunt among the boatmen first and received various answers one said she lived in the south foreland light and had singed her whiskers by doing so another that she was made fast to the great buoy outside the harbour and could only be visited at halftide a third that she was locked up in maidstone jail for childstealing a fourth that she was seen to mount a broom in the last high wind and make direct for calais the flydrivers among whom i inquired next were equally jocose and equally disrespectful and the shopkeepers not liking my appearance generally replied without hearing what i had to say that they had got nothing for me i felt more miserable and destitute than i had done at any period of my running away my money was all gone i had nothing left to dispose of i was hungry thirsty and worn out and seemed as distant from my end as if i had remained in london the morning had worn away in these inquiries and i was sitting on the step of an empty shop at a street corner near the marketplace deliberating upon wandering towards those other places which had been mentioned when a flydriver coming by with his carriage dropped a horsecloth something goodnatured in the man’s face as i handed it up encouraged me to ask him if he could tell me where miss trotwood lived though i had asked the question so often that it almost died upon my lips ‘trotwood’ said he ‘let me see i know the name too old lady’ ‘yes’ i said ‘rather’ ‘pretty stiff in the back’ said he making himself upright ‘yes’ i said ‘i should think it very likely’ ‘carries a bag’ said he‘bag with a good deal of room in itis gruffish and comes down upon you sharp’ my heart sank within me as i acknowledged the undoubted accuracy of this description ‘why then i tell you what’ said he ‘if you go up there’ pointing with his whip towards the heights ‘and keep right on till you come to some houses facing the sea i think you will hear of her my opinion is she will not stand anything so here is a penny for you’ i accepted the gift thankfully and bought a loaf with it dispatching this refreshment by the way i went in the direction my friend had indicated and walked on a good distance without coming to the houses he had mentioned at length i saw some before me and approaching them went into a little shop it was what we used to call a general shop at home and inquired if they could have the goodness to tell me where miss trotwood lived i addressed myself to a man behind the counter who was weighing some rice for a young woman but the latter taking the inquiry to herself turned round quickly ‘my mistress’ she said ‘what do you want with her boy’ ‘i want’ i replied ‘to speak to her if you please’ ‘to beg of her you mean’ retorted the damsel ‘no’ i said ‘indeed’ but suddenly remembering that in truth i came for no other purpose i held my peace in confusion and felt my face burn my aunt’s handmaid as i supposed she was from what she had said put her rice in a little basket and walked out of the shop telling me that i could follow her if i wanted to know where miss trotwood lived i needed no second permission though i was by this time in such a state of consternation and agitation that my legs shook under me i followed the young woman and we soon came to a very neat little cottage with cheerful bowwindows in front of it a small square gravelled court or garden full of flowers carefully tended and smelling deliciously ‘this is miss trotwood’s’ said the young woman ‘now you know and that is all i have got to say’ with which words she hurried into the house as if to shake off the responsibility of my appearance and left me standing at the gardengate looking disconsolately over the top of it towards the parlour window where a muslin curtain partly undrawn in the middle a large round green screen or fan fastened on to the windowsill a small table and a great chair suggested to me that my aunt might be at that moment seated in awful state my shoes were by this time in a woeful condition the soles had she would themselves bit by bit and the upper leathers had broken and burst until the very shape and form of shoes had departed from them my hat which had served me for a nightcap too was so crushed and bent that no old battered handleless saucepan on a dunghill need have been ashamed to vie with it my shirt and trousers stained with heat dew grass and the kentish soil on which i had sleptand torn besidesmight have frightened the birds from my aunt’s garden as i stood at the gate my hair had known no comb or brush since i left london my face neck and hands from unaccustomed exposure to the air and sun were burnt to a berrybrown from head to foot i was powdered almost as white with chalk and dust as if i had come out of a limekiln in this plight and with a strong consciousness of it i waited to introduce myself to and make my first impression on my formidable aunt the unbroken stillness of the parlour window leading me to infer after a while that she was not there i lifted up my eyes to the window above it where i saw a florid pleasantlooking gentleman with a grey head who shut up one eye in a grotesque manner nodded his head at me several times shook it at me as often laughed and went away i had been discomposed enough before but i was so much the more discomposed by this unexpected behaviour that i was on the point of slinking off to think how i had best proceed when there came out of the house a lady with her handkerchief tied over her cap and a pair of gardening gloves on her hands wearing a gardening pocket like a tollman’s apron and carrying a great knife i knew her immediately to be miss betsey for she came stalking out of the house exactly as my poor mother had so often described her stalking up our garden at blunderstone rookery ‘go away’ said miss betsey shaking her head and making a distant chop in the air with her knife ‘go along no boys here’ i watched her with my heart at my lips as she marched to a corner of her garden and stooped to dig up some little root there then without a scrap of courage but with a great deal of desperation i went softly in and stood beside her touching her with my finger ‘if you please madam’ i began she started and looked up ‘if you please aunt’ ‘eh’ exclaimed miss betsey in a tone of amazement i have never heard approached ‘if you please aunt i am your nephew’ ‘oh lord’ said my aunt and sat flat down in the gardenpath ‘i am david copperfield of blunderstone in suffolkwhere you came on the night when i was born and saw my dear mama i have been very unhappy since she died i have been slighted and taught nothing and thrown upon myself and put to work not fit for me it made me run away to you i was robbed at first setting out and have walked all the way and have never slept in a bed since i began the journey’ here my selfsupport gave way all at once and with a movement of my hands intended to show her my ragged state and call it to witness that i had suffered something i broke into a passion of crying which i suppose had been pent up within me all the week my aunt with every sort of expression but wonder discharged from her countenance sat on the gravel staring at me until i began to cry when she got up in a great hurry collared me and took me into the parlour her first proceeding there was to unlock a tall press bring out several bottles and pour some of the contents of each into my mouth i think they must have been taken out at random for i am sure i tasted aniseed water anchovy sauce and salad dressing when she had administered these restoratives as i was still quite hysterical and unable to control my sobs she put me on the sofa with a shawl under my head and the handkerchief from her own head under my feet lest i should sully the cover and then sitting herself down behind the green fan or screen i have already mentioned so that i could not see her face ejaculated at intervals ‘mercy on us’ letting those exclamations off like minute guns after a time she rang the bell ‘janet’ said my aunt when her servant came in ‘go upstairs give my compliments to mr dick and say i wish to speak to him’ janet looked a little surprised to see me lying stiffly on the sofa i was afraid to move lest it should be displeasing to my aunt but went on her errand my aunt with her hands behind her walked up and down the room until the gentleman who had squinted at me from the upper window came in laughing ‘mr dick’ said my aunt ‘do not be a fool because nobody can be more discreet than you can when you choose we all know that so do not be a fool whatever you are’ the gentleman was serious immediately and looked at me i thought as if he would entreat me to say nothing about the window ‘mr dick’ said my aunt ‘you have heard me mention david copperfield now do not pretend not to have a memory because you and i know better’ ‘david copperfield’ said mr dick who did not appear to me to remember much about it ‘david copperfield oh yes to be sure david certainly’ ‘well’ said my aunt ‘this is his boyhis son he would be as like his father as it is possible to be if he was not so like his mother too’ ‘his son’ said mr dick ‘david’s son indeed’ ‘yes’ pursued my aunt ‘and he has done a pretty piece of business he has run away ah his sister betsey trotwood never would have run away’ my aunt shook her head firmly confident in the character and behaviour of the girl who never was born ‘oh you think she would not have run away’ said mr dick ‘bless and save the man’ exclaimed my aunt sharply ‘how he talks do not i know she would not she would have lived with her godmother and we should have been devoted to one another where in the name of wonder should his sister betsey trotwood have run from or to’ ‘nowhere’ said mr dick ‘well then’ returned my aunt softened by the reply ‘how can you pretend to be woolgathering dick when you are as sharp as a surgeon’s lancet now here you see young david copperfield and the question i put to you is what shall i do with him’ ‘what shall you do with him’ said mr dick feebly scratching his head ‘oh do with him’ ‘yes’ said my aunt with a grave look and her forefinger held up ‘come i want some very sound advice’ ‘why if i was you’ said mr dick considering and looking vacantly at me ‘i should’ the contemplation of me seemed to inspire him with a sudden idea and he added briskly ‘i should wash him’ ‘janet’ said my aunt turning round with a quiet triumph which i did not then understand ‘mr dick sets us all right heat the bath’ although i was deeply interested in this dialogue i could not help observing my aunt mr dick and janet while it was in progress and completing a survey i had already been engaged in making of the room my aunt was a tall hardfeatured lady but by no means illlooking there was an inflexibility in her face in her voice in her gait and carriage amply sufficient to account for the effect she had made upon a gentle creature like my mother but her features were rather handsome than otherwise though unbending and austere i particularly noticed that she had a very quick bright eye her hair which was grey was arranged in two plain divisions under what i believe would be called a mobcap i mean a cap much more common then than now with sidepieces fastening under the chin her dress was of a lavender colour and perfectly neat but scantily made as if she desired to be as little encumbered as possible i remember that i thought it in form more like a ridinghabit with the superfluous skirt cut off than anything else she wore at her side a gentleman’s gold watch if i might judge from its size and make with an appropriate chain and seals she had some linen at her throat not unlike a shirtcollar and things at her wrists like little shirtwristbands mr dick as i have already said was greyheaded and florid i should have said all about him in saying so had not his head been curiously bowednot by age it reminded me of one of mr creakle’s boys’ heads after a beatingand his grey eyes prominent and large with a strange kind of watery brightness in them that made me in combination with his vacant manner his submission to my aunt and his childish delight when she praised him suspect him of being a little mad though if he were mad how he came to be there puzzled me extremely he was dressed like any other ordinary gentleman in a loose grey morning coat and waistcoat and white trousers and had his watch in his fob and his money in his pockets which he rattled as if he were very proud of it janet was a pretty blooming girl of about nineteen or twenty and a perfect picture of neatness though i made no further observation of her at the moment i may mention here what i did not discover until afterwards namely that she was one of a series of protegees whom my aunt had taken into her service expressly to educate in a renouncement of mankind and who had generally completed their abjuration by marrying the baker the room was as neat as janet or my aunt as i laid down my pen a moment since to think of it the air from the sea came blowing in again mixed with the perfume of the flowers and i saw the oldfashioned furniture brightly rubbed and polished my aunt’s inviolable chair and table by the round green fan in the bowwindow the druggetcovered carpet the cat the kettleholder the two canaries the old china the punchbowl full of dried roseleaves the tall press guarding all sorts of bottles and pots and wonderfully out of keeping with the rest my dusty self upon the sofa taking note of everything janet had gone away to get the bath ready when my aunt to my great alarm became in one moment rigid with indignation and had hardly voice to cry out ‘janet donkeys’ upon which janet came running up the stairs as if the house were in flames darted out on a little piece of green in front and warned off two saddledonkeys ladyridden that had presumed to set hoof upon it while my aunt rushing out of the house seized the bridle of a third animal laden with a bestriding child turned him led him forth from those sacred precincts and boxed the ears of the unlucky urchin in attendance who had dared to profane that hallowed ground to this hour i do not know whether my aunt had any lawful right of way over that patch of green but she had settled it in her own mind that she had and it was all the same to her the one great outrage of her life demanding to be constantly avenged was the passage of a donkey over that immaculate spot in whatever occupation she was engaged however interesting to her the conversation in which she was taking part a donkey turned the current of her ideas in a moment and she was upon him straight jugs of water and wateringpots were kept in secret places ready to be discharged on the offending boys sticks were laid in ambush behind the door sallies were made at all hours and incessant war prevailed perhaps this was an agreeable excitement to the donkeyboys or perhaps the more sagacious of the donkeys understanding how the case stood delighted with constitutional obstinacy in coming that way i only know that there were three alarms before the bath was ready and that on the occasion of the last and most desperate of all i saw my aunt engage singlehanded with a sandyheaded lad of fifteen and bump his sandy head against her own gate before he seemed to comprehend what was the matter these interruptions were of the more ridiculous to me because she was giving me broth out of a tablespoon at the time having firmly persuaded herself that i was actually starving and must receive nourishment at first in very small quantities and while my mouth was yet open to receive the spoon she would put it back into the basin cry ‘janet donkeys’ and go out to the assault the bath was a great comfort for i began to be sensible of acute pains in my limbs from lying out in the fields and was now so tired and low that i could hardly keep myself awake for five minutes together when i had bathed they i mean my aunt and janet enrobed me in a shirt and a pair of trousers belonging to mr dick and tied me up in two or three great shawls what sort of bundle i looked like i do not know but i felt a very hot one feeling also very faint and drowsy i soon lay down on the sofa again and fell asleep it might have been a dream originating in the fancy which had occupied my mind so long but i awoke with the impression that my aunt had come and bent over me and had put my hair away from my face and laid my head more comfortably and had then stood looking at me the words ‘pretty fellow’ or ‘poor fellow’ seemed to be in my ears too but certainly there was nothing else when i awoke to lead me to believe that they had been uttered by my aunt who sat in the bowwindow gazing at the sea from behind the green fan which was mounted on a kind of swivel and turned any way we dined soon after i awoke off a roast fowl and a pudding i sitting at table not unlike a trussed bird myself and moving my arms with considerable difficulty but as my aunt had swathed me up i made no complaint of being inconvenienced all this time i was deeply anxious to know what she was going to do with me but she took her dinner in profound silence except when she occasionally fixed her eyes on me sitting opposite and said ‘mercy upon us’ which did not by any means relieve my anxiety the cloth being drawn and some sherry put upon the table of which i had a glass my aunt sent up for mr dick again who joined us and looked as wise as he could when she requested him to attend to my story which she elicited from me gradually by a course of questions during my recital she kept her eyes on mr dick who i thought would have gone to sleep but for that and who whensoever he lapsed into a smile was checked by a frown from my aunt ‘whatever possessed that poor unfortunate baby that she must go and be married again’ said my aunt when i had finished ‘i cannot conceive’ ‘perhaps she fell in love with her second husband’ mr dick suggested ‘fell in love’ repeated my aunt ‘what do you mean what business had she to do it’ ‘perhaps’ mr dick simpered after thinking a little ‘she did it for pleasure’ ‘pleasure indeed’ replied my aunt ‘a mighty pleasure for the poor baby to fix her simple faith upon any dog of a fellow certain to illuse her in some way or other what did she propose to herself i should like to know she had had one husband she had seen david copperfield out of the world who was always running after wax dolls from his cradle she had got a babyoh there were a pair of babies when she gave birth to this child sitting here that friday nightand what more did she want’ mr dick secretly shook his head at me as if he thought there was no getting over this ‘she could not even have a baby like anybody else’ said my aunt ‘where was this child’s sister betsey trotwood not forthcoming do not tell me’ mr dick seemed quite frightened ‘that little man of a doctor with his head on one side’ said my aunt ‘jellips or whatever his name was what was he about all he could do was to say to me like a robin redbreastas he is“it is a boy” a boy yah the imbecility of the whole set of ‘them’ the heartiness of the ejaculation startled mr dick exceedingly and me too if i am to tell the truth ‘and then as if this was not enough and she had not stood sufficiently in the light of this child’s sister betsey trotwood’ said my aunt ‘she marries a second timegoes and marries a murdereror a man with a name like itand stands in this child’s light and the natural consequence is as anybody but a baby might have foreseen that he prowls and wanders he is as like cain before he was grown up as he can be’ mr dick looked hard at me as if to identify me in this character ‘and then there is that woman with the pagan name’ said my aunt ‘that peggotty she goes and gets married next because she has not seen enough of the evil attending such things she goes and gets married next as the child relates i only hope’ said my aunt shaking her head ‘that her husband is one of those poker husbands who abound in the newspapers and will beat her well with one’ i could not bear to hear my old nurse so decried and made the subject of such a wish i told my aunt that indeed she was mistaken that peggotty was the best the truest the most faithful most devoted and most selfdenying friend and servant in the world who had ever loved me dearly who had ever loved my mother dearly who had held my mother’s dying head upon her arm on whose face my mother had imprinted her last grateful kiss and my remembrance of them both choking me i broke down as i was trying to say that her home was my home and that all she had was mine and that i would have gone to her for shelter but for her humble station which made me fear that i might bring some trouble on heri broke down i say as i was trying to say so and laid my face in my hands upon the table ‘well well’ said my aunt ‘the child is right to stand by those who have stood by himjanet donkeys’ i thoroughly believe that but for those unfortunate donkeys we should have come to a good understanding for my aunt had laid her hand on my shoulder and the impulse was upon me thus emboldened to embrace her and beseech her protection but the interruption and the disorder she was thrown into by the struggle outside put an end to all softer ideas for the present and kept my aunt indignantly declaiming to mr dick about her determination to appeal for redress to the laws of her country and to bring actions for trespass against the whole donkey proprietorship of dover until teatime after tea we sat at the windowon the lookout as i imagined from my aunt’s sharp expression of face for more invadersuntil dusk when janet set candles and a backgammonboard on the table and pulled down the blinds ‘now mr dick’ said my aunt with her grave look and her forefinger up as before ‘i am going to ask you another question look at this child’ ‘david’s son’ said mr dick with an attentive puzzled face ‘exactly so’ returned my aunt ‘what would you do with him now’ ‘do with david’s son’ said mr dick ‘ay’ replied my aunt ‘with david’s son’ ‘oh’ said mr dick ‘yes do withi should put him to bed’ ‘janet’ cried my aunt with the same complacent triumph that i had remarked before ‘mr dick sets us all right if the bed is ready we will take him up to it’ janet reporting it to be quite ready i was taken up to it kindly but in some sort like a prisoner my aunt going in front and janet bringing up the rear the only circumstance which gave me any new hope was my aunt’s stopping on the stairs to inquire about a smell of fire that was prevalent there and janet’s replying that she had been making tinder down in the kitchen of my old shirt but there were no other clothes in my room than the odd heap of things i wore and when i was left there with a little taper which my aunt forewarned me would burn exactly five minutes i heard them lock my door on the outside turning these things over in my mind i deemed it possible that my aunt who could know nothing of me might suspect i had a habit of running away and took precautions on that account to have me in safe keeping the room was a pleasant one at the top of the house overlooking the sea on which the moon was shining brilliantly after i had said my prayers and the candle had burnt out i remember how i still sat looking at the moonlight on the water as if i could hope to read my fortune in it as in a bright book or to see my mother with her child coming from heaven along that shining path to look upon me as she had looked when i last saw her sweet face i remember how the solemn feeling with which at length i turned my eyes away yielded to the sensation of gratitude and rest which the sight of the whitecurtained bedand how much more the lying softly down upon it nestling in the snowwhite sheetsinspired i remember how i thought of all the solitary places under the night sky where i had slept and how i prayed that i never might be houseless any more and never might forget the houseless i remember how i seemed to float then down the melancholy glory of that track upon the sea away into the world of dreams
